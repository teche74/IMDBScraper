                "Content": "So I was left a little disappointed after the last film, something just seemed to be missing but this really hit the spot.The 2 central characters still have great chemistry, but this felt a lot more like an ensemble piece with more fleshed out characters around them. I'm just going say #Reggierocks.Some great cinematography with lots of fab camera and drone work zooming around all over the place. The first person gun work at one point added a new dimension.Miami looks beautiful with the Orange and Teal tones.Action galore and a good protagonist in Eric Dane, although his motive and why he is doing what he is, was pretty rubbish, but he still played it well, and to be fair you don't come in to this sort of film hoping for Shakespeare level story telling.Some fun cameos pop up which raise a smile.The soundtrack is good and Lorne Balfe delivers on the orchestrated score.It has all you would expect from a Michael Bay production. Definitely life still in the franchise.\n\n                    105 out of 138 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Title": "\"You're my bad boys. Now clear my name.\"",
                "Content": "The fourth entry in the revitalised buddy cop, action, comedy franchise. Bad Boys: Ride or Die sees wisecracking Miami cops Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) embark on a dangerous mission to clear the name of their late police captain when he gets linked to drug cartels.Firstly, they missed a trick not calling this instalment Bad Boys 4 Life, alas we cannot have everything we desire. Anyway, it was inevitable that we were going to get a fourth (and potentially fifth) as 2020's actual Bad Boys For Life made nearly half a billion dollars and due to the pandemic, was in the top 3 highest grossing of that year.It has been too long since I watched the first film (it is long, long overdue a rewatch), however Bad Boys II I return to every couple of years when I require a dousing of Bayhem. Has it aged well? Nope. Is it obnoxious and overlong? Yes. Does the action rule? Hell yes! The third film I found solid, yet disappointing, it lacked the grit and sleaze of its predecessor and incorporated a bizarre supernatural element that didn't quite click.This was a real step up from three and balances the slick, modernised lega-sequel of the previous film with the sleaze and chaos of Bay's entries. Admittedly it's a little bit of a rushed and rocky start and narratively the film isn't bringing anything particularly new to the table, yet it's clearly relishing its heightened mid-00's vibes. Once Marcus returns a from death's embrace with a new outlook on life and spirituality and Mike's fears for his family, his own mortality and a reconnection with his fugitive son come to the forefront of his anxieties, the film adds a surprising layer of character work that still manages to incorporate dick jokes and f-bombs aplenty.Action-wise this boasts some of the franchise's best set pieces. Director's Adil El Arbi & Bilall Fallah certainly lean a bit heavier into the Bayism's here than in BBFL. A slow-motion, sped up and gloriously chaotic digital, neon tinged art exhibition shootout is very Bay. A superb John Wick-esque home invasion shootout (featuring a well deserved triumphant moment for a fan favourite character) and the *entire* finale section of the film is a bar setter for shootouts this year. The incorporation of first person POVs, drones, alligators, explosions aplenty mix together for a riotous bloody blowout.Performance-wise this was certainly the best way Will Smith could properly return after the Oscars controversy (I know he had Emancipation a few months after the incident, but I don't think anybody apart from me watched it). His more vulnerable and subdued fatherly moments as Mike are well executed... as well as the kick ass swagger that established the character. However, it's Martin Lawrence that steals the show. A motormouth, wide-eyed, born again foul mouthed spiritual guide who claims he can't die. He's having a ball and both he and Smith's chemistry is still unbeatable. Supporting players Jacob Scipio, Ioan Gruffudd, Rhea Seehorn and Reggie himself Dennis Greene are all locked in to the material.Bad Boys: Ride or Die was a bullet riddled, cackle worthy blast of throwback fun that was a step up from my expectations. Smith & Lawrence are still a great duo, the action is killer and the balance of soap opera sincerity and over-the-top drama balances effectively with the motor-mouthed bickering and gags. Sure, the plot isn't particularly standout and the film is a little choppy in the first act, but when the wheels begin to fully spin, the film charges off the start line.\n\n                    84 out of 119 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "It must be a lot of fun to write these 'Bad Boys' movies. The two lead characters really are great and they play off each other so well. And even if you wrote something in the script that was so-so, you know you've got a couple of great actors who will make it work. There were a couple of lines in this movie where I thought to myself, on paper that probably wasn't all that funny, but they found a delivery that got a chuckle out of me.There's everything you could want out of a 'Bad Boys' movie in this one. The action is there, the laughs are there, there's a great menacing villain and there are some fun side characters to help carry the load. We are four movies into the series and have yet to see a drop-off in standard whatsoever. Bring on the next one I say. 8.5/10.\n\n                    60 out of 90 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

It maybe also has to do with the fact that this was the first Bad Boys movie I've watched in the big screen, naturally making the experience more exciting and memorable, but I also feel like the movie has a lot to make it likeable - be it the rather cliché but effective script, the callbacks, the action, the excitement and most of all, the amazing chemistry between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence.Overall, the movie is pretty fun and while not all jokes land, it's still decently funny and entertaining at the same time.\n\n                    18 out of 49 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "Bad Boys is back and it's so much fun, action packed and hilarious! More Martin Lawrence than the last one had which I really loved cause he was hilarious in this one too and so many types of jokes in this! Martin also had a really funny shootout scene involving food. Action was badass with the great choreography the last one had and more of that brutality too with bloody heavy hitting scenes, one scene I thought I was watching John Wick! There is probably one scene I wasn't keen on which is when someone has an out of body death experience, didn't match the grounded story. But the rest of the story was thrilling and connected to all the past bad boys films which I can appreciate it more for that, especially seeing the relationship between Mike and his son. Mike had some more character work with his panic attacks and even Marcus showing age and toll of the job they do. Final showdown was epic with tons of action with some really unique stuff to have fun with. Music they used too was really epic of course \"Bad Boys\" song but the song \"Tonight\" was really awesome and the use of those songs made it so much more amazing! Some really interesting camera angles especially during the final face off and as a wannabe cinematographer I appreciate them trying new things and seeing them work. It's good to see actors such as Rhea Seehorn, Eric Dane and Ioan Gruffudd in more roles too! There is also a Michael Bay cameo which was pretty cool! A great Bad Boys film that is epic on scale, hilarious and action packed fun!\n\n                    40 out of 73 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Let's talk about it using the key components of a movie.Direction: Not too awful. It might have been better with more information regarding the character development, scene continuity, actor dialogue modulations, and setting.Plot: The plot of this film is weak. There are no enhancements over any of the prior stories or materials, and the plot itself is not new.Screenplay: It appears that there is no need to rewrite the screenplay for this film. It may have changed places, attire, and other equipment from the original script.Dialogue: The dialogue in this film is informal and typical given the circumstances. A portion of them are useless.Cinematography: This film emphasizes the use of cameras. Particularly in the action scenes. Not that awful, actually.Acting: Will's entertaining dialogues aren't all that memorable, and his acting is lifeless. Several times, Martin has overacted. That could be the characterization, I don't know. However, something is absent.Editing: The hue and lighting aren't very appealing. VFX and blue screen are provided as usual. For the huge screen, some effects are quite unique. It's interesting to watch fight scenes with musical accompaniment.Stunt: As long as there is minimal usage of blue screens, the stunts in this film are good.Soundtrack: It's alright. The stunt scenes' background music is well-done.Attraction: To put it simply, the Bad Boys movie's entertainment value is \"okay.\" It is not a thrilling, suspenseful action film. A typical action movie, nothing noteworthy to say.\n\n                    37 out of 69 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Title": "You get what you come for",
                "Content": "It's been four years since we were allowed to see the last Bad Boys film. To everyone's delay, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence returned as agents Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnet. Of course, the first mentioned was discredited at the 2022 Oscar ceremony, after he sold actor Chris Rock a bang for his head after making a joke by his wife. Because the whole world spoke of shame about this, it became a bit quiet around Smith and he has done little more. This fourth Bad Boys film should give his career a big boost again and time will tell if the world has already forgiven Will Smith. In my case, I never blamed him for anything and I thought it was all very exaggerated how everyone reacted. I have always found Smith a good and above all nice actor and nothing has changed at all to date. The third Bad Boys For Life from 2020 is nice, but didn't manage to hit the level of the first two films, I expect the same from this fourth part and that's fine, because this will be a lot of action and humor where entertainment is guaranteed.And that's it, Bad Boys: Ride or Die gives exactly what you expect in advance and offers a tight two hours of pure popcorn entertainment. The film opens with a bickering Mike and Marcus. Marcus has to live healthier for his health, but when the two with screeching tires race across the highway, Marcus really wants to get something to drink. He gets 85 seconds, where Marcus seizes this moment to buy a hot dog and war Skittels within that time, but then the case is robbed. When Mike furiously walks into the case, a gun is immediately pointed at him, but Mike immediately starts whining at Marcus about his eating behavior. Bam! Opening film, something that immediately leaves its mark on the rest of the film. The gradient just fits perfectly with the predecessors and the directors on duty know how to make the course go as it should. Perhaps a point of criticism is the rather dynamic camera work. You may not really realize this at the beginning of the movie, but when the big action scenes come, it sometimes works disturbingly. Especially in the big end fight, where switching to a first person shooter mode, it looks rather cheap shooting. This was already shown in a making off, in which Smith controlled the image with his movements with a camera around his waist or on his arm.The movie is really full of spectacular action and it's impossible for you to get bored. When Mike and Marcus try to purge the name of their deceased chief commissioner, they are forced to work with the captured Armando, son of Mike of course and bad guy in the previous film. Armando is the only one who can identify who is behind the plot. Unfortunately, the shoe is a bit pinching there, because although the writers may have tried to keep the story mysterious where the outcomes should amaze the viewer, the course and the outcome is very predictable and that is a shame. You will actually know quite quickly how or what in the 'trust no one' cat-en-mouse game where you eventually get stuck with a 'see' feeling. That's quite a shame, because this could perhaps have been prevented with some better writing, where you would still have a reasonable surprise to expect, but none of that. You actually see this very often in these kinds of films and of course you don't go there for a heavy plot twist where your mouth falls open, but here a very easy way is chosen to stay honest. Does that affect the film a lot for the rest? No, because as indicated earlier, you just get what you want and what you expect.Bad Boys: Ride or Die is already the fourth film in the series and gives you as a viewer exactly what you expect from it. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are the bickering police duo again and end up in an explosive situation again. Perhaps a little more attention should have been paid to the story itself, because that is very predictable, but well, because you are constantly entertained, a large part of the audience will be a concern. However, the camera work is sometimes just a little too dynamic, making some things difficult to follow. For the rest, this is just popcorn entertainment from the top shelf and as mentioned you just get what you come for, a lot of fun humor with action, action and more action. If the Belgian directors Bilall Fallah and Adil El Arbi continue to do this, they can still make a few films, because this is just wonderful set your mind on blanc and just watch and enjoy without fuss or other difficult hassle.\n\n                    7 out of 20 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

This is entertainment after all!\n\n                    43 out of 85 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "I looked forward to Bad Boys: Ride or Die as I really enjoyed Bad Boys for Life. It retains a lot of the positive things which have made the past films fun such as impactful action, R rated jokes and family dynamics. That came with a bunch of side characters new and old and an okay plot but there is one thing that lets this movie down and it's Martin Lawrence's character, Marcus Burnett.Unfortunately, it's becoming all too common in Hollywood for a character to be so over the top for a movie that it just becomes distracting.After surviving a near death experience at the beginning of the film, Marcus is high on life and he literally acts as if he is high for the rest of the film. This went beyond fun and playful to the point where it was distracting and annoying. It led to many frustrating scenes which felt like they belonged in a cartoon including one scene where the characters chose one of the worst possible moments to sing the Bad Boys theme.In the End, Bad Boys Ride or Die is a frustrating but okay film which could have been much better with different narrative choices although many people might enjoy the direction that the film went.\n\n                    3 out of 11 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "Bad Boys is one of the best buddy em cop action comedy franchise and with 4th part it looks like they've run their course. I enjoyed this movie but it offers nothing new it is just same as last film which I found amazing because 3rd one came after a very long time after 2nd one, but this time magic and charm don't work.. Chemistry between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence is the real soul of these movies their comedy timing is perfect and they can still kick some ass even after 30 years.. Story was same as many other movies we've seen before good guys gets framed for something which they didn't do, they catch bad guys and defeat them. The End. There are some good action scenes in this movies mostly consists of shootouts ,I think 2nd one has the best action sequences because that was directed by Michael Bay who is known for making big scale action pieces, after some time you'll get bored seeing same action again and again but it was still very fun to see on big screen especially the FPS gun scene during climax.. Cinematography consisting of Skylines shots of Miami was cool to see, soundtrack was good and acting of man leads was the best part of movie...\nOverall I enjoyed this movie as a Summer popcorn flick, if you love action comedies with some of the old famous actors of Hollywood you should catch it on big screen. You will enjoy it..\n\n                    19 out of 34 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Regarding the story, compared to Bad Boys for Life, it was of a lower level because it didn't have many surprises and twists like the previous one. And regarding the screenplay, the previous movie had a better screenplay than this one because the scenario and the order of events and how they are presented was a lot better, and cought the attention of the person who is watching more.But this does not mean that I didn't like Bad Boys: Ride or Die. I liked it, and I am looking forward to see what more the franchise will have in the future. That is why when it comes to the score, I give Bad Boys: Ride or Die 7 out of 10.\n\n                    2 out of 6 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "I loved the first two and felt like the third was very, very off tone and out of place for the \"trilogy\". If like me you disliked the third, you will hate for forth. Where the third introduced this bazaar soap opera styled movie with a witch and a long lost son, this one they introduce.... god? And soul mates..... its funny I completely missed the warlock and demons in the first and second film.I genuinely hope this movie makes enough money to fund a 5th film just so they can afford Michael bay and some decent writers! Because I love seeing Will and Martin together and the characters (at least the OG version of them were so great). Why have they made Marcus SOOO dumb... it didn't work for Thor love and thunder and it doesn't work here.The directors need to quit and just work for MTV it's genuinely like they have never seen the first two films and have only HEARD about Bay's style of directing. Just because you can fit a camera in a seemingly impossible position doesn't mean you should do it every 3 minutes. Every shot and scene in this film is just flooding with an attempt to be stylish or cool or bay-esc. The camera is constantly spinning or moving it makes Bay's shaky cam feel like a tripod. Also what's with ALL the colour/neon!? Every close up I swear has either a red, green or purple glow to it; unless it's interior, in which case you are treated to over the top lens flare from curtain less windows. The OG films looked beautiful but also had some grit to them.Point is I am a fan so wanted to like it but it didn't look good, it wasn't funny and it just felt like the franchise is going the same direction as fast and the furious but some how less entertaining.The last two films have been a crime to cinema, how they got Will and Martin to sign their contracts I will never know.How two thirds of this film was ever put on the page, I will never know. It felt like a straight to DVD waste of time.\n\n                    11 out of 18 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

The villain lacks he's not very interesting but has some cool scenes. I like how the plot of there old captain dying and they need to find out what happened. The suspense with finding out who the rat was was cool. The pacing is great there's great action throughout. The 3rd act was epic with great action and was better than I thought it was ganna to be.

                "Content": "So, let's be honest here, did we get a Bad Boys four so fast because of what the Fresh Prince did at the Oscars? I'm gonna assume so and I'm almost happy he did (just kidding)\nRide or Die is an excellent action film. The car chases, the gun fights the explosions it was pretty fantastic. The directors did some experimenting on some of the action sequences that did not fully get me excited but I'm not mad at the experiment.Martian Lawrence and Will Smith still have the chemistry. These two known how to bounce the jokes off each other. They got Lowery and Burnett down. One of the best on screen duos ever.As the Franchise goes, I think this movie is better because of the near back-to-back from their last outing Bad Boys for Life (back-to-back in comparison to 17-year gap between For Life and Bad Boys II). It continues the developing story between Lowery and his estranged son. Vanessa Hodges, Paola Nunez and Alexander Ludwig official join the family and then there is that interesting story arch between Burnett and his son in law that hit a peak in this movie after technically going on for three movies.Look if you like Bad Boys, you're going to like Bad Boys: Ride or Die. The only buddy cop franchise better is Lethal Weapon. Can't wait to see if Lethal Weapon 5 is half as good as Bad Boys 4.\n\n                    1 out of 4 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "George Miller... \"Why yes, yes I do. Well sort of anyway...\"I really really wanted to love Furiosa but in the end I didn't, I liked it but didn't love it. Big big shoes to fill, I completely love Fury Road - a perfect action film in every way, so I was prepared to have this film fall in its shadow. Which it did. Furiosa is fun but its sadly no FR.The good news:\nYou want action? There is action, loads of it. Like any good Mad Max story it holds true to its promise to entertain the masses with spectacle. Glorious. We get the hot rods, big wheels, diggers, bikes of all shapes and sizes, as well as flying contraptions, weaponry galore and no holding back on the violence. Explosions, bodies flying, witness me etc. Plenty. It can be brutal and nasty but true to form and true to Mad Max. What more do you want?Casting is good, perhaps a few too many characters leaving each of them to have not quite enough to do especially with Immortan Joe's followers. Anja Taylor Joy is good as Furiosa and Hemsworth seems to really be enjoying himself. Dementus is a great villain, a sort of love child of Immortan Joe and The Humungus; the presence, the wee speeches, his villainy is fun. And he gets to be very Aussie no need to hide that accent. I also liked a younger and much cleverer Immortan Joe; in this film he's not the core bad guy and without the need to get his 5 wives back as a motivator making him crazy we get to see him as the warlord he is. Smart and patient and in control.And there's world building! Which was very cool. We got to see more of the Wasteland and get hints of how it ticks and what made it so.The bad news:\nVisually Furiosa is a bit of a mixed bag; sometimes we get stuff worthy of its predecessor and other times we get stuff that is... less so. The colour is much more pale than the richness of FR and the cinematography is no where near the standards. Occasionally the CGI lets the film down just a bit. In Fury Road you got the impression that it was almost all practical effects even if it wasn't. In Furiosa there are sequences where I went... 'eww, yikes' as the standards of the film dropped. Only a few moments but be prepared.The music is often absent or very lacking. The sweeping epics of Fury Road are almost gone instead we get much more background stuff or even sadly largely silent action sequences. This leads to a lack of tension, nothing edge of your seat here.The writing and edit isn't great. The characters lack spark and bits feel missing. Miller is trying to tell a story but seems unsure of how to write characters in which one can invest. Furiosa has more ambition in its story telling and I think its execution is lacking. The core story solid but it seems a bit empty on the screen. The film jumps at times skipping over character development worthy of exploration.In the edit i really really missed the fast cuts of Fury where Miller really built his scenes through tight production and cuts and edits where everything builds beautifully and leads to a great conclusions. Miller did this scene after scene in FR whereas in Furiosa its really lacking. Means theres not as much tension, not as many 'that was close' nor 'that was amazing' moments.Overall I did like it. Furiosa is a good Mad Max film but its no Fury Road. I'd be surprised if the film is recognized at Oscar time, where Fury Road won 6 Furiosa might get a nomination or two in the technical but no nominations for Directing or Best Picture.By my deeds I honour him...By my wallet I honour George Miller, Witness Furiosa. Its worth your time and money but not more than that.\n\n                    447 out of 560 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Slow paced, little bit boring and dragged on.. I was kinda waiting for the movie to just end.

                "Content": "It would be folly to try and outdo Fury Road and Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is smart enough to not even attempt that. It's a completely different film in its structure which allows it to be a prequel that tells a complete story on its own whilst still enhancing Fury Road with its world building. The fact that George Miller is still telling stories in the wasteland at this scale is a real gift.Alyla Brown gets a lot more screen time than child versions of pre-established characters usually get and with next to no dialogue she is superb at communicating everything without words. Carrying that on for the second half, Anya Taylor-Joy does a phenomenal job and was right to fight to keep the scream in. If you need someone to act exclusively with their eyes, she is as perfect as they come.Chris Hemsworth is clearly relishing the opportunity to play a properly mad villain with Dementus and has so many chill inducing moments. This is easily the best he's been so far, completely unhinged with just enough depth to explain everything he does. He's a complicated figure who always seeks power but is never able to truly hold onto it.George Miller truly is a genius when it comes to exploring this franchise. Getting to see a fully realised Gas Town and Bullet Farm allows this world to cohere like never before and the action crafted here is so epic with gorgeous imagery that refuses to slow down. Just like John Seale achieved last time, Simon Duggans's cinematography can keep the action clean no matter what's thrown at it.It makes sense that the only way Tom Holkenborg could come close to his best work on Fury Road was to return to the wasteland and his score here continues to compliment the kineticism of the action so well. The only downside is the CGI which looks pretty bad at various points and stands out further because of how well Fury Road implemented it.\n\n                    176 out of 264 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "I feel many go into Furiosa expecting a Mad max movie, and at its core it is so much different. With its predecessor being Fury road, Furiosa had a very high bar to achieve. However, these 2 movies are so different, while they may seem similar they are completely different action movies. Furiosa takes on a much more different aesthetic with the use of slightly more darker and less vibrant colors, a much different protagonist, and a more complex story. The use of cgi is pretty disappointing, if you have a keen eye you can pretty easily the digital doubles and green screen. Anya Taylor-Joy gives an absolutely amazing performance. Dare I say she is better than Charlize Theron in Fury Road? Absolutely! Chris Hemsworth was also great and hilarious. Furiosa, while it may have many flaws, is one of the best action movies to come out in recent times, and I hope it gets the recognition it deserves. Furiosa is in no ways perfect, but do I love it? Yes.\n\n                    140 out of 230 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

She was great! Chris Hemsworth as Dementus was funny, scary and...demented! This role of a villain was great for him and much much better than the last Thor interpretations!Anya Taylor-Joy was, from my perspective, a much better Furiosa than Charlize Theron! She did an amazing job!The CGI was there but it was top notch and the ones who complained about the use of CGI doesn't understand a movie like this needs some CGI!The vehicles, motorbikes were steampunk constructed and cool! Dementus truck was a BEAST!!! The roaring of the engine was beyond cool! It was amaaaaazing! The young Immortan Joe was decent, his boys are there(from Mad Max: Fury Road) .Some little brutality, little humor that worked like a jewel!A little minor Spoiler: i think there was a little, very little scene of Max filmed from behind..there was his car as well. The verdict: A must seen, a must seen in theater for the best feeling! The sound of motorbikes and that beast, the Dementus truck motor engine sound was so cool!!! 9/10 from me!\n\n                    168 out of 286 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "Furiosa would be easier to watch if Fury Road never happened. After the incredible cinematography magic that genius John Seale weaved, Furiosa felt just like some lacklustre adaptation of a far superior source material.Only thing I found charming was the overall 80's feel, resembling the style of a Road Warrior, and some scenes feel like they were recreated straight from the original trilogy. While action sequences are, as expected, top notch, the epic sense of awe and sheer crazy excitement that ludicrous stunts and choreography brought us in Fury Road was lacking. Editing was sometimes atrocious. Even in the best action or \"poignant\" scenes this movie had to offer, I never felt that I'm watching it from the edge of my seat, nor did I get emotionally involved with any of characters.Speaking of which, acting was fairly wooden, lines declamatory delivered, the script overall seemed recycled and overly done, bordering on boring. Storytelling was chaotic, rushed and dragged at the same time. Sometimes the unnecessary narrator helped things to move along, unfortunately in a bad way.But the major flaw was that there was no hero's journey for any of characters. Furiosa is the same person at the beginning as she is at the end of a movie, same as Dementus. Remember Nux and his journey? There is nothing like it in Furiosa. Furthermore, Furiosa endures every hardship with the same fierce look in her eyes - we never see pain, never fear, never doubt. She shrugs any injury off, like a terminator. It was hard to get emotionally involved with her character. Unfortunately, she came across as a classic girl boss, amazing in everything she does from the start to the finish, as a kid, and as an adult. Relationship between Furiosa and Praetorian Jack is so robotic and unemotional it's painful to watch. Dementus's monologue at the end was a snoozefest. All in all, I witnessed it, and found it mediocre.\n\n                    437 out of 588 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

The look is off everything from camerawork to editing to the costumes to vehicles to action scenes. Loads of bad CGI replaces the high octane realistic crazy stunts and motor mayhem from fury road. It all looks shot in a studio with fake everything. Big drop in quality and a sense of realism.It's sad to see that Miller has settled for the studio instead of real vehicles in real environments with neck breaking stunts. Both clothes and vehicles just looks very designed now as well instead of a somewhat believable mishmash of what can be found in the wastelands. It's also a-lot cleaner in every way, vehicles look shiny and newly made. It just feels more censored and less naked and rough.The story surprises nobody and is pretty much exactly what you expect. Void from a lot of the epic action scenes you might have to expect after fury road. You get some decent action but Fury Road is the gold standard here and this is not even close. Look and feels more like a cookie cutter action movie set in the Mad Max universe. Had I have to guess without knowing it I would never have guessed that Miller directed this. The world building is cool though and you get more of the cool world of Mad Max so that is a big plus.Actors do a decent to a good job all around.Immortan Joe is not impressed.MEDIOCRE!!!\n\n                    418 out of 656 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Title": "A Great Expansion of Fury Road",
                "Content": "One of my biggest unpopular movie opinions is that I'm just not that crazy about Mad Max: Fury Road. I admire it as an action vehicle but as a movie overall it just really leaves me wanting. I've thought this for years but it only really got confirmed to me once it rewatched it the day before I finally saw this movie. The fact that this movie was supposed to be so different from Fury Road was quite appealing to me going in since I don't totally gel with that movie and overall I'm amazed by how much I enjoyed it given my somewhat mixed feelings on the predecessor.I think where this film succeeds for me compared to Fury Road is that it does takes its time more. There's considerably more world building and moments to breathe between the action scenes. In Fury Road this was very much absent by design but I loved the fact that Miller took a different approach here. I really liked the gradually pace this film took and how it fleshed out this surprisingly interesting world. The one thing I can't deny about Fury Road is how incredible the action scenes are and that's no different here. I think the big difference for me is that there's more build up to them and as such I thought there were more stakes going into them. They're long and jaw dropping in scale and it really does give me an urge to finally watch the original films.The performances and character work are also top notch and I really appreciate the fact that those are things George Miller doesn't skimp on in his action movies. Anya Taylor-Joy is basically perfect as Furiosa and obviously she's going to be compared with Charlize Theron but ultimately I think both of their portrayals compliment each other very well. While her arc does follow a template we've seen before I ultimately thought it worked very well and I was always interested what action she was going to take next. A big credit for that has to go to Chris Hemsworth who is outstanding and this is easily the best performance I've ever seen him give. He's not the deepest villain I've ever seen but's he's very memorable and Hemsworth gives such an entertaining performance that I just always wanted to see more of him on screen. Tom Burke was also great in a role that I thought was surprisingly wholesome but also quite mysterious in all the right ways.The story itself though is definitely where the film falters the most for me though. It's split up into very distinctive chapters and in many ways I liked that about it but it also hurt the pacing somewhat. It felt as if the film had to keep re-starting with every new chapter and for as jaw dropping as the action scenes are their length became a bit tiring since the story is so bare bones. I also think the actual ending could've been stronger given that it very much leads directly into Fury Road and the transformation of the Furiosa here into the one in that film didn't feel entirety earned to me.I had no idea what to expect going into Furiosa but I was so pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. It feels like such a natural expansion of the world set up by Fury Road and the character work is surprisingly very strong. It definitely has its weaker aspects but as someone who's not the biggest fan of the predecessor I really appreciated how this movie gave me more than I could've possibly expected.\n\n                    53 out of 108 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

This prequel to the critically acclaimed \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" not only expands the lore of the titular character but also redefines the boundaries of the action genre. Anya Taylor-Joy had 30 lines of dialogue that delivers a tour-de-force performance as Furiosa, embodying the character with a fierce determination and emotional depth that captivates from the first frame. Chris Hemsworth's portrayal of the villainous Dementus is both charismatic and menacing, providing a perfect foil to Furiosa's heroism. George Miller's direction after watching FURY ROAD is nothing short of masterful & beautiful creations of what road action is really like; he crafts a narrative that is both expansive and intimate, with each set piece surpassing the last in scale and spectacle. The cinematography is a character in itself, painting the Wasteland of \"WHAT A LOVELY DAY\" with a palette that is as beautiful as it is desolate.\"Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga\" is a testament to the power of myth-making. It's a film that not only honors its predecessors but also stands on its own as a monumental achievement in cinema. With a perfect blend of relentless action, compelling characters, and a story that resonates with the human spirit's indomitable will, this film is the best films of this year of action. It cannot be lower at all. It delivers the goods with a gold plaque.\n\n                    147 out of 342 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "Let me start off by saying this, if you enjoyed the last movie, you'll probably get a good time out of this one. That being said, it's night and day when you compare the two. I'm a huge fan of the last one, the spectacle and action make it one of the best films of all time imo, and it's clear they tried to recreate that with this movie, but for me it falls flat. Most, if not all, action sequences are all CGI, it's good CGI, but you can absolutely tell it's CG. There are lots of times in the movie where it straight up just looks out of a video game. I get where this comes from, the shots they go for are definitely a bit more ambitious, but it's lacking the chunky and gritty realism of the last film. The action can seem floaty and overly ragdolly at times because of this. Regardless, this isn't my biggest complaint with the movie, my biggest is the story. There are times when things just happen for no good reason at all, in an effort to avoid spoilers, I won't list them, but they are painstakingly obvious. For example, an integral character gets killed and it seems to be of zero consequence to one of the characters, even though the movie spends some time trying this half baked romance. I also just couldn't get into Anya Taylor-Joy as furiousa, maybe it's just a me thing, but she just doesn't really fit the gritty role she's meant to play. Chis Hemsworth is a standout performance though, although I do think, again, the writing for his character is a bit garbage. Regardless, this is a fun movie, lots of cool action shots, and pretty good if you have no preconceptions and expectations stemming from the last movie.\n\n                    21 out of 28 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Didn't think his character as the villain could be played with such depth - he was perfectly cast, and wouldn't be surprised if he gets several best supporting actor nods during award season.The quality of the acting overall was a surprise, but I expected awesome action sequences, and it didn't disappoint: the War Rig fight scene is just awesome. Miller and his team stepped it up even more from Fury Road, still giving the same look and feel of the brutal Wasteland, but with even more grittiness and realism, obviously taking advantage of advances in production since 2015.Overall it is one of those rare prequels that is better than what was already a great sequel.

The name Star Wars is unspecified and can easily include all things that happened in the galaxy far, far away.Now is this (to some people, a very small point) important enough to go on this sort of rant? Well my principles (and maybe primarily my OCD) says yeah, it is.So anyway, go ahead. Judge me! However I think honesty is important. Especially from someone who's trying to sell you something.\n\n                    43 out of 92 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "George Miller is a genius. That is undoubtedly the most important thing to remember when watching Furiosa.The way he constructs the world's and characters to fit his imagination is unparalleled. The action set pieces are so incredibly woven in to his story lines that you find it hard to understand how he starts creating a film like this.I was lucky enough to attend the UK premiere of the film and hearing members of the cast and crew talk so passionately about the process helped me to understand the enormity of creating a project like Furiosa.Chris Hemsworth steals the show as Dementia, the villainous gang leader, obviously having huge fun in a turn that contrasts so much from his usual turns as the hero of the piece. There are excellent turns from Anya Taylor-Joy, Tom Burke and Alyla Browne as Young Furiosa, helping to create an emotional understanding of how the character becomes so hell-bent on revenge.At times, there is a complexity that seems unnecessary and becomes slightly frustrating at times when character development is taking precedence over action. In some ways the film is a victim of its own brilliance. Because the action sequences are so thrilling it does feel as though there just aren't enough of them. If you are going in to Furiosa expecting to see Fury Road, mark two then you may be a little disappointed.However, if you are all in on this futuristic dystopia that Miller has created them you will be in for a treat.\n\n                    38 out of 91 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

The story and the themes it deals with, storytelling, performances of the cast, especially the ones of Joy and Hemsworth, direction, visual and sound effects, action sequences, cinematography, violence, soundtrack, and ending are all excellent and have nothing to be said against them.Regarding the flaws, from my point of view, I saw two flaws in the movie, first, some story elements which were overlapping and confusing, and second, the 148 minutes runtime, which was too long to some extent. If the movie's runtime was 120 minutes, like Mad Max: Fury Road, that would have been much better.I liked Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, and I am looking forward to see what the Mad Max franchise will have in the future.

The lack of contrast and ups and downs in the film prevents you from getting engaged and understanding it. Even the director fails to create the suspense he aims to instill in you. In terms of special effects and sound quality, if I were to compare it with the film \"Dune II\" that I watched on the same IMAX screen two months ago, I must say it was really unsuccessful in this area.

You were good enough for this not to stain you, but the next thing has to be better.For a real comeback, please buy the rights to Dark Angel and remake it, perhaps with Joss Whedon as director with a fair bit of violence, plot complexity, and anti-hero character development.Anyway, please fire your career advisor and don't let the combat training you did go to waste.\n\n                    15 out of 24 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "It's always ominous when a film is Netflix 'straight to streaming' and lead actress (the still gorgeous) Jessica Alba hasn't made a decent movie in years, so no surprise here then, it's pants.Things actually start out ok with a well choreographed action sequence, but soon descend into formulaic tv movie territory once Alba returns home to the New Mexico desert after receiving news of the mysterious death of her ex-marine father.The paper thin plot involves a bunch of dodgy local illegal arms dealers and corrupt local politics with Alba going into full-on female Chuck Norris mode once she finds out what's going on amongst the cliches and sagebrush.Of course the storyline has been done a million times (better) before, the no-name supporting cast are bland and throwaway while the screenplay meanders along to its generic ending almost two hours later!In summation, this forgettable rubbish would've been better served as a mini-series on Hulu or Peacock rather than a Netflix feature film! Oh well, time to break out the X-Files and Twin Peaks DVDs again and remember what good viewing USED to look like.\n\n                    48 out of 57 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

I felt all of the emotions they wanted me to feel.I think most people will enjoy The Fall Guy.

                "Content": "In an era where blockbusters often demand homework, with their intricate universes and complex lore, \"Barbie\" emerges as a delightful outlier. Movies today, from the sprawling epics of \"Dune\" to the interconnected sagas of the MCU, seem to require a viewer's full dedication-and maybe even a notepad to keep up. This isn't to diminish their artistry, but it's clear that the pure joy of cinema, the sort of effortless fun Hollywood once peddled so well, has become a rare find. A film that welcomes you without prerequisites, \"The Fall Guy,\" seeks to reignite that spark of unadulterated entertainment. It aims to dazzle with the sheer magnetism of its leads, thrust into a whirlwind of romance and adventure, harking back to the days when stunts were real and filmmaking was a team sport, offering a joyride that's as heartwarming as it is thrilling.Hollywood's narrative-rich turn hasn't dulled the magic of star power, a fact \"The Fall Guy\" embraces wholeheartedly, reminiscent of a time when the charm of icons like Burt Reynolds was all the spectacle one needed. Ryan Gosling proves his mettle as a jack-of-all-trades, winning hearts even in the most casual settings, his performance in this film further cementing his versatile appeal.\"The Fall Guy\" also champions the unsung heroes of cinema: the stunt performers. Through breathtaking feats and daredevil escapades, it pays homage to the risk-takers who've silently shaped cinematic history, although it's not without its critiques, especially in how it sidelines some of its stellar cast in the latter half.Yet, beyond the adrenaline, there's a poignant commentary on the digital age's challenges to authenticity, making \"The Fall Guy\" a vibrant counterpoint to the prevailing trends of faceless, CGI-dominated blockbusters. It's a film that doesn't just want to entertain; it wants to remind us of the value of genuine connection, both on the screen and in the stunts that make us hold our breath. In doing so, it doesn't just invite audiences to have fun; it demands it, championing the kind of cinema that's been overshadowed by the gravitas of today's tentpoles.\n\n                    184 out of 266 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "The Fall Guy acts best as a glorious ode to the art of stunt work. Perhaps never before have a film been focused so much on the unseen heroes behind many great films - the stunt doubles delivering shockingly realistic portrayals of the action. And in that respect The Fall Guys succeeds- it's action sequences are delivered flawlessly, and are breathtaking to behold. They climax to a crescendo at the ending, where a several vehicles crash, flip and explode, all in sync with action involving a helicopter in the sky with our main character. Praise should also be given to the films two charismatic leads. Emily Blunt and Ryan Gosling share palpable chemistry and are simply endearing to behold. They are affable, amiable, and funny. But ultimately my problem with this film is that it is unevenly paced, lacks enough humour, and has too thin a plot to retain an audiences full attention. The films firstly takes too long to get its plot started, resulting in a laborious introduction, a sped through mid section, and a bombastic but slightly rushed ending. The film also does not exert its full potential of comedy. The film does not make use of action comedy(as best exemplified by the Jackie Chan films) or a particularly witty script. Indeed the script is rather dull, sometimes trite, and altogether not very sharp or exciting. Then there is the films plot. I can comment not much other than that it is the recyclable convoluted B-grade plots which are common in movies. It is predictable, ludicrous, and quite inexcusable. So at the end of the day, The Fall Guys is a good comedy that acts as a wonderful tribute to the art of stunt work, bolstered by strong, effervescent performances between its two leads. But for movie watchers who do not care much for the films impressive stunts, The Fall Guys will prove to be a rather empty watch. Serviceable, but unexceptional.\n\n                    148 out of 221 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Ryan and Emily are excellent, what really can't be said about any among the rest of the cast. There is a bit of action, but surely not as much as one expects according to the title and the fact of the movie being based on the old series of the same name. There is also some comical romance, but nothing really too convincing. The last 15 minutes plus the credits showing the \"making of\" scenes to one side of the screen, are the most enjoyable, especially as there are some (somewhat expected) cameos for movie lovers. 6/10 points.\n\n                    50 out of 73 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Have always thought of him as a great actor but never realized he can be good at playing a silly cartoonish and very stereotypical character also. He was hilarious! !Overall it's not to my personal taste at all but this is an okay movie.

The casting is great, the stunts are brilliant, the plot is fairly thin but hey, it's a popcorn movie. Not everything has to be Oscar worthy.I'd really love to see more movies like this released. Very little CGI, good stunts and just fun. The homage to the stuntmen at the end of the movie was a really nice touch too.

However for a project like this to work satisfactorily, regardless of the talent involved, it must be written well, it must be directed well. This is written badly and it doesn't hold together, and the direction is poor, it's a stupid story that doesn't work.That accepted I enjoyed many elements, the stunts, some of the jokes, the sometimes ridiculous neon hair-shimmering slow-motion cinematography, the ultimate man-cave sequence, Ryan's jackets, Emily's catsuit-belt-combo (with invisible holster), the on-set movie-making exposition-demonstration-magic similar to HBO's Irma Vep...the behind-the-scenes stunt-reel over the end credits...until that last bit.Look, I'm glad everyone is enjoying themselves, I just think it is also possible to make a good story out of a fun concept, so we can all enjoy it, and somehow that's not what happened here.\n\n                    133 out of 229 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Title": "Stuntmen injured so that Tom Cruise could shine",
                "Content": "The Fall Guy acts as a homage to all the stuntmen and stuntwomen out there. This is a love letter to the stunt team, a film dedicated to showing the grittiness and the roughness of the industry and how the movie industry will fall apart without them. Not only that, this is also a film for anyone who loves films or filmmaking in general.Just like how Barbie was meta for the toy industry, The Fall Guy is meta for the filmmaking industry. Plenty of subtle and hidden messages that were incorporated in the script. Ex: There was one scene that spontaneously mentioned on how the stunt team didn't get any recognition at the Oscars. There was even distinct mentions or references of Taylor Swift, Dune, Kill Bill and Miami Vice amongst many others. Plenty were about the movie industry that if you spotted those things, you would truly have a good time in the cinemas.Marketed as an action rom-com, this film didn't fill its promise with the comedy. It's an element that's just lacking from beginning 'til the end. Of course, it wasn't empty, it had its moments but for a comedy film, it didn't achieve the bar it was supposed to. You might be smiling or left out a few chuckles, but they weren't anything that were just worth bursting out loud. Again, comedy is extremely subjective.The Fall Guy did very well the first 30 minutes of the film. Everything you wanted it to be was conveyed really well. David Leitch opened the film about a film who's working for that film. It fully maximizes everything exciting regarding this subject. The main focus was about filmmaking and the stunt community. It shed light on these unsung heroes, showcasing their dedication and talent in bringing action-packed scenes to life. And damn, it is very good and entertaining.When the second act came in, we started to lose a bit of interest in this movie. Mainly due to its shift of focus that it somehow turned into a murder mystery genre. First act was very good that it talked a lot on filmmaking, and almost every scene was located in a production set. The dialogues were also heavy on that. But the middle part focused more on the murder mystery and romance. While they still included a lot of the meta elements here but they turned its way into a more generic film when it could have been so much more.Even most of the dialogues during the romance scenes were just not as good as the rest of the script. They just didn't maximize the stuff they were talking about. Some dialogues felt meaningless. Some were just flat out boring. Some have meanings but if only they could polish them, this movie would have been so much better.Luckily, Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt sparked a good chemistry on set. Even with a moment of no dialogues, just when they're looking at each other, you'll know well enough their chemistry is just electrifyingly good. There were moments they weren't physically together, but the film showed them on a split screen and etc. But the palpable connection between them remained strong.The movie redeems itself at the third act. It's a very epic ending and you rarely see this kind of ending in an action rom-com movie. The action and the scope were big and the messages were all very on-point with the whole theme of the film. It's bombastic but it's lovely at the same time. It's less on fighting or punching, but more on the performing of stunts. 2-3 scenes felt and looked like they came straight out from old classic films. There's just a certain way that the ending was shot that it gave a homage to old action movies. It's indeed a sight to behold.Verdict: A love letter to the unsung heroes, The Fall Guy pays homage to the stunt community, exploring their hardships behind the scenes through the lens of both a director and a stuntman. While it falls short on delivering promised comedy, its first act shines with interesting filmmaking commentary. Despite a weak second act, strong chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt along with an epic finale elevate the film, delivering a visually stunning tribute to classic cinema.P. S: There's a mid-credit scene! Stay tuned!\n\n                    101 out of 179 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "Whatever problems The Fall Guy has really aren't an issue when the final product is this much fun. It's a loving tribute to the never ending selflessness of stunt people wrapped inside of an endearing romantic comedy and meta action film. If David Leitch and 87 North did all the action in cinema the world would be a better place.Ryan Gosling achieves new levels of perfection by merging the reserved stunt man character of Drive with his natural Kenergy. His version of Colt is just so lovable, especially because he's completely unafraid to be open in his vulnerability which makes him more relatable whilst being really funny. His comedic timing continues to be faultless, proving he can make any joke land.Emily Blunt thankfully also gets a lot to do. Any scene she shares with Gosling is effortlessly charming and she has her own brand of bona-fide movie star charisma. Winston Duke is a great movie referencing support to Gosling, Aaron Taylor-Johnson does a hilarious McConaughey impression and Hannah Waddingham's cartoonishly over the top producer really works.David Leitch's direction plays squarely to his strengths and after the disappointment of The Gray Man, it's extra satisfying to see Gosling be given some actually good fight scenes. Stunt designer Chris O'Hara and the whole stunt team really accomplished some breathtaking feats that are only made more impressive by seeing how they shot them during the credits.\n\n                    163 out of 240 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "\"The Fall Guy (2024) is a film that owes much of its watchability to the presence of Ryan Gosling, whose performance elevates an otherwise weak storyline. While Gosling's portrayal adds depth and charisma, the movie suffers from a disjointed plot that leaves viewers with unanswered questions and moments that feel unnecessary.One of the film's shortcomings lies in its lack of clarity and connection to the central plot, leading to confusing scenes that detract from the overall narrative coherence. Emily Blunt, despite her talent, is constrained by underdeveloped scripting for her character, Jody, resulting in a relationship dynamic with Gosling's character, Colt, that lacks believability and depth. The imbalance in character development creates a sense of manipulation and blame within their relationship, which undermines the emotional connection the film tries to establish.Nevertheless, The Fall Guy does have its bright spots, with humorous scenes, witty lines, and commendable performances from supporting actors Aaron Tyler-Johnson as Tom and Hannah Waddingham as Gail, who bring life to their villainous roles.Ultimately, while Ryan Gosling's performance shines, The Fall Guy struggles to fully engage me as an audience due to its weak storyline and character dynamics.\n\n                    24 out of 50 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

A stuntman making ends meet as a bounty hunter.So the trailers made no link to the television show at all. Ryan Gosling was expecting another gigantic hit after the success of Barbie. It soon became clear why this movie failed to set the box office alight. A weak screenplay.Colt Seavers (Ryan Gosling) is the stuntman who got badly injured while doubling for big screen star Tom Ryder (Aaron Taylor-Johnson.) He always claims to do his own stunts.Colt got out of the movie industry. Some time later he gets a call from producer Gail (Hannah Waddingham) to go out to Australia as Ryder has gone missing.It would allow Colt to reunite with Jody (Emily Blunt), a camera operator he had the hots for. She is directing the movie in Australia and if Ryde cannot be found, the studio will pull the plug.Maybe Universal Studio should had pulled the plugged for this until they had a better story. It takes a while to get going. It is a hackneyed plot.It is left for the stunts to do the heavy lifting. They are good but not amazing. The plot is the drag.At least there is a reference to the television show at the end. Maybe this should had been about stuntman turned bounty hunter. Instead you have to take the title of the film literally.There were a few nice touches. When Colt saves a person with force, there was the Six Million Dollar Man sound effects used. During a boat chase, there is the Miami Vice theme.\n\n                    17 out of 34 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Never taking itself seriously with a wink to the audience - grab your popcorn, and your choc top and enjoy 2hrs of fun.\n\n                    166 out of 261 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

I think in any case that today Ryan has been typecast in these roles, as happens in Barbie and that although he is useful today, perhaps in the future not so much.Emily Blunt in a totally secondary role and with a romance with Gosling's character that borders on the cloying and not very credible at times.The point is that this movie is an action nonsense that lasts more than 2 hours and that is appreciated as long as we close our minds to any other analysis.The action scenes and how it is filmed are the best of this film, at times it rivals the best of John Wick in that sense.The humor works no matter how crude and physical comedy it is.It's basically an action movie from the 90's, it reminds us a lot of Arnold's \"Last Action Hero\" and that's appreciated.In short, a good movie for a Saturday afternoon, it is not strictly necessary to go to the cinema to see it but it is very entertaining.\n\n                    26 out of 57 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

It was all very satisfingly colorful. Mr. Gosling made it look real. I like Mrs. Blunt in pretty much everything she does. Whoever wrote the \"jokes\" in this movie didn't appeal to my sense of humor. I spent most of the movie feeling bad for the people falling, crashing through things, getting hit by fists or cars or whatever.Surprising twist at the end. Wait until the movie is available to rent, though, unless you can get a movie ticket for $7 or less (which I did). I have no desire whatsoever to watch this film again.

So, I had to watch it, despite low scores.The dumb people in this film don't listen, do dumb things, and get killed. But it's been filmed well; it's intense, the sound design and cinematography keep you engaged. Shark graphics - decent enough. It's got enough going on to keep you engaged, the plot is not boring at all. The ending may have you scratching your head though.Here's a perspective that I don't think anybody is considering - I don't know the first thing about Shark Biology or marine evolution, but I looked at the 'Sharks' as a metaphor for 'Climate Change' and the plot AND the ending suddenly made so much more sense. That made me feel like the movie was actually better than people are making it out to be.Either that, or I'm just trying to convince myself that I didn't waste 2 hours watching stupid people make stupid decisions.\n\n                    64 out of 84 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

The two main characters have to battle a large, complex shark against the backdrop of Paris. No spoilers, but I would definitely recommend that you watch the entire film until the end for the ultimate conclusion. The characters here are forgettable and, once again, most of them fall easily into the stereotypical roles that people in shark films have to in order for the body count to be higher.Overall, this film was much better than I anticipated it to be, with the middle dragging out until the tension finally starts to ramp up.\n\n                    46 out of 65 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

The first half of the movie wants so badly to be Jaws, you can almost hear the theme music playing every time Sophia has a flashback, but once they go into the catacombs and discover Lilith's nest, things veer into the realm of the ridiculous, admittedly the best aspects of the film.\n\n                    15 out of 19 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Here it is the politician who wanted a triathlon in Paris despite the shark.

In between both of them is scientist Sophia ( (Berenice Bejo). The ending which I will not spoil is shocking and abrupt to say the least.

Not much good to it actually. There are no good dialogues, no good character development and you don't really feel any attachment whatsoever to any of the characters so you don't care what happens to them.

It's part eco-horror and full B-movie sci-fi thriller-a vibe that definitely worked for the movie. It's not full of relentless action, but *Under Paris* serves enough over-the-top, shark-infested sequences to give you a bloody good time while providing enough dramatic heft to prove that it is not your average shark slasher. The effects aren't the greatest, but they get the job done. Also, the ending is ridiculously over the top and insane, and it makes the movie that much better.Got a real Jaws 3 vibe from the movie & I mean that in the best way.\n\n                    22 out of 44 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Anne Marivin does a good job playing a completely incompetent, dishonest, ruthless, politically driven mayor of Paris that everyone will recognize easily. The only differences are that she's pretty and she can speak French.

                "Title": "This French produced shark thriller is exactly my kind of trash that delivers the goods effectively and efficiently",
                "Content": "Three years after losing her research team and husband to an attack by an abnormally large Mako shark named \"Lillith\" the team had been tracking at the Pacific Garbage Patch, marine biologist Sophia Asslas (Berenice Bejo) is approached by Mika (Lea Leviant) of the environmental group S. O. S. Or Save our Seas saying the group have located Lillith's tracker in the Seine with incidents such as a driver crashing into the Seine and the body not being recovered. Initially skeptical, Sophia's fears are soon confirmed as circumstances soon see her team with Adil (Nassim Lyes) of the French police's River Brigade to try to handle the situation while dealing with potentially life threatening interference from both S. O. S. As well as the publicity and money hungry Mayor of Paris (Anne Marivin) who is hosting a triathlon in the Seine.Under Paris is the latest Netflix release and comes to us via versatile genre director Xavier Gens. The movie is another entry in the well tapped well of the subgenre of Shark movies that ever since the release of Jaws have come to acknowledge that bar will never be set with some opting for character studies, some using the format as an excuse for cheapness, while others go to the extreme of over the top excess (see examples of Deep Blue Sea and The Meg films). With Under Paris or Sous la Seine we definitely have an example of over the top excess and it's the best kind of ridiculousness that I'll admit I'm a sucker for.While the movie has an environmental subtext in discussing real world issues like climate change and the Pacific Garbage Patch, that's honestly pretty secondary so this is less An Inconvenient Truth and more The Day After Tomorrow if the villain were sharks instead of global warming. From the opening slaughter at the garbage patch that cuts loose with the blood and gore in a rather refreshing fashion (even if I'll admit I could've gone for some more practical work intermixed with what we have) Under Paris delivers the intensity and excess you'd expect from a movie like this and it unapologetically dives in and goes for it. The acting from our leads of Berenice Bejo and Nassime Lyes is good and I give the actors props for treating this material as seriously as they would a procedural like Spiral. Anne Marivin serves as our secondary antagonist as a greedy mayor a la Jaws who isn't even trying to be subtle from her introduction that has her gesticulating over a scale model of Paris illustrating her big plans for the triathlon. And last but not least we have the shark itself Lillith, while the effects to bring the shark aren't top of the line (it's a modestly budgeted French film), what the producers lack in finer detail and rendering power they more than make up for with creativity and spirit. While they could've stopped with the idea of \"shark in the Seine\" and that would've been plenty to sell the movie, they go several steps beyond and the revelations about the shark not only have (sometimes literal) Earth shattering effect, but become borderline apocalyptic.I'll admit it's difficult to objectively review a movie like Under Paris because you can find no shortage of logical and scientific leaps that it takes, but it's that all too rare B-movie that could that commits to a bonkers high concept premise without feeling the need to wink at the camera and let the audience know it's in on the joke. It has scares that work, the action's exhilarating, and it's just fun. Sometimes all you need is fun escapist nonsense and you'll find that here I assure you.\n\n                    18 out of 36 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

And this horror thriller is also an ecological thriller, as also was John Frankenheimer's 1982 PROPHECY. But at least Xavier Gens the director is back to France, where he began in 2007 with the terrific FRONTIERES. In the meantime, he worked for the Hollywood industry. This disaster horror thriller from France is of course daring, and proceeds the today's tendency for French film industry to produce action and horror flicks - film de genre, as we say in France - which was rather rare so far. Or exceptional. This one is good, not terrific, and, I repeat, it is funny that it is aired one month before the Olympic Games in Paris. But why not? At least the sharks don't fly, as in SHARKNADO. But the finale of this one is totally, definitely, entirely unbelievable, unrealistic at the most. And so fun, crazy and gloomy in the same time. A total surprise that may leave you puzzzled.\n\n                    3 out of 4 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Fondly named Lilith, the shark wrecks havoc, killing most of Sophia's crew. 3 years later, Sophia is yet to move on completely from the incident and the losses she faced, an youth activist approaches her to inform Lilith is now back in Seine. The transition from saltwater to freshwater shark baffles her and soon Sophia's realizes the threat. As they try to convince the police who are dismissive, the mayor however is hell bent on kickstarting the triathlon, afterall it's one shark to contain. With the stage set up, what does Lilith bring to the show forms rest of the story.For one, I definitely enjoyed this film and I will admit that after a long time, here comes a good shark film. There is no sugar coating till the actual story begin as director Xavier Gens means business. As we are introduced to the giant Lilith, we are clear what's in store. There is an acceptable explanation to why this particular shark could transform itself into surviving in freshwater and no time is wasted in creating any drama or sci-fi mumbo jumbos. The CGI is off at many instances but that didn't put me off.Once Sophia reaches out to the police then it's all Lilith's mayhem and it was totally worth it. The encounter with the ill informed activists was definitely the highlight. However, the set up for the Piranha-esque climax with the triathlon and shark on the loose, I was bit disappointed with lesser gore and though repetitive, I still wanted to see that in full glory. They did replace it with even more crazy stuff and the CGI was actually passable here. I may not be too keen for the sequel if it were to be made but I was all the more satisfied with Under Paris. Bottom line is it entertained me.\n\n                    7 out of 13 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

The best I can say is that the actors manage to do an okay job with what little they have to work with. Which is a flimsy nonsensical premise about a mutant shark that decides to take a trip to Paris. Mix in some clumsy environmental messaging, and the main characters reasons for hunting the shark, and another reason why the incompetent politician refuses to take the problem seriously (sounds familiar), some truly awful CGI shark effects, and we end up with something that's not as ridiculous as the Sharknado films, but definitely not as good as something like Deep Blue Sea, which is still pretty silly. If we're going to compare it to Jaws, it's definitely more Jaws: The Revenge than the original. The end of the film has to be seen to be believed.\n\n                    17 out of 23 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

The story is simple but profound, using the 3rd eye or journalism, doing its best to tell an unbiased perspective of the what the world looks like at its most biased... a civil war. See it on the biggest screen and the best sound system you can. Its not a call of duty campaign, its not saving private Ryan, its its own thing so clear your head of expectation and just take the ride.\n\n                    257 out of 425 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "America is getting sick. Alex Garland has offered us a vaccintion for what ails us. Like a serum for snake bite made of venom itself, this film grabs us by the shoulders and screams \"You got a civil war fantasy? Fine, I'll put it on a 40 foot screen and dare you to cheer.\"Civil War finds it's foundational vision in the eyes of those who for decades have brought us the soul shattering reality of war, free from the romance of Hollywood patriotism- war journalists whose frenzied, conflicted oddysey plunges them into a mad gauntlet of fire and film, killing and kodachrome. Like soldiers in a war of attrition, they must constantly reassess the purpose of thier risks and sacrifices as they watch their colleagues fall for the sake of the priceless pictoral story of war. Three generations of war correspondants traveling together into the insanity becomes the testiment to three phases in the life of such a calling.We are introduced to the strangeness of how soldiers, out for blood, tolerate and facilitate the prescence of these unarmored observers every step of the way through the hell of combat. Garland seems to tap into some unspoken ethos of universal creedance among combatants that the history of it all must be seen and those who record it must survive to tell of it. It is never explained, merely displayed.We are reminded that in a modern Americn civil war, rogue atrocity can roll through your city just as easy as it did for My Lai. If you think that in the fog of war we would maintain our civility and morality like gentlemen, think again. For every five patriots there might be one psychopath ready to fill ditches with the innocent dead executed under the jurisprudence of a few unhinged men with guns.We have no idea why this war is being fought. Perhaps it is a just war. Perhaps it is a crazed cessationist rebellion. We aren't afforded such information. It would only get in the way of the vital message-war is hell and be careful when you tell your fellow American to go to hell for thier political differences. What you end up with might be far darker and damning than you ever dreamed.The genius of this film rests partially in an absurd alliance between California and Texas, two of the most opposite states in the Union. By joining this ideological odd couple, the story immunizes itself against accusations of partisanship or cultural favortism. Yet it also beckons us to imagine what kind of national crisis could bring such opposites together.This film will be awarded there is no doubt. Alex Garland has broken new ground and his script and actors and cinemetography deserve all the awards they get.\n\n                    593 out of 1,040 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

This is a movie about war correspondents . . . That's it. It's not \"an American tale\" or anything special in terms of impact. It's just a very well done war movie, with bad guys and good guys, and they can be from either side of the political spectrum. I found it pretty, well-shot and production design is great as well. But I found it hollow, without the detail that I would have liked to have seen about the two sides. I think that Garland didn't focus on any of that because he didn't want to be accused of picking a side. But without it. It's simply a movie about people shooting guns. Lots of loud noises and explosions, and the (interesting) character development of a set of photo journalists.\n\n                    212 out of 335 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

To say it's formulaic doesn't take things much further because what isn't these days. There's no actual plot but that's also allowed lately. It's a bit odd that there's no explanation at all about how the USA has found itself in a civil war or as to why the president is ultimately portrayed as such an unsympathetic character but that is ok too since it's really all about the journey of the central characters. As to those characters, they're somewhat stereotypical. You've got the photo hack who's seen all the horrors of war ( in case we didn't get this we are shown a sequence of her reminiscences) there's the ingenue and, as is normal, the hero's reluctance to take her on board and the usual mix of support. In the end you have the new girl getting on with business and proving that she's the real deal. If the characters are a bit cliche'd, the dialogue hardly helps with lines like (I'm paraphrasing because I can't recall exactly but something like) \"I've never felt so scared in my life, but I've never felt more alive\". It's a bit like a mixture between Watership Down and Apocalypse Now except it really doesn't match up to either of those.\n\n                    101 out of 166 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Title": "Masterpiece about war journalism. A phenomenal Kirsten Dunst",
                "Content": "Let me start with: the discourse around this film is truly fascinating-and I think it's incredible to read this some time after watching the movie. The trailers were kind of awful marketing imo. This is a character-driven story, but in the most tense way possible. Anything can happen at any moment, and the left swerves are constant. I have to stress that OH MY GOD you have to see this on the big screen! It's one of the most immersive films I've ever seen-I wasn't pulled out of it for even a second and it is so bloody beautiful!I should not have loved this movie, but I did, because it has some truly wild universal implications-it's not limited to the US at all. I had to take a long time to process this film, but I understand the breathless first reactions: this is not like anything I've seen before, for one particular reason. I also totally get the Apocalypse Now comparisons: now there's another film that contradicted each impulse it put out. One might say that by nullifying itself it too was \"empty\"-but of course it wasn't. This movie is pretty meta: what I think and say will say a lot about me and how I see the world. That's super cool! But it's not about war (outside of being an anti-war film). It's about war journalism, and spectacle.A lack of context might annoy people. And why? Well, frankly, because this is a movie that is opposed to American exceptionalism. It aggressively shoves your face in its sameness actually. It renders it banal; a war zone like any other country in another war film where most American viewers likely have little idea of the opposing parties or actors involved. Every gun shot is loud as hell, every explosion is far too much: spectacle, yes, and people ask \"to what end?\" I find it radical. One can make up five different backstories of how Texas and California seceded separately and then allied against a fascist President: but the only reason you'd have a problem with the fact that Civil War doesn't tell you is because you're too attached to the American-ness of it all. America? Depicted like any other? The cheek! Jesse Plemons' character heavily evokes the Khmer Rouge. There's so many other examples-they remind you of somewhere else (Vietcong references, Afghanistan/Iraq imagery, less domestic parallels than international ones tbh). I admire the provocation to us Americans, I really do. This film is about the spectacle of war and how it would look today: literally any war, anywhere, and here! And it's using the most provocative, iconic setting to do that.The performances are OFF THE WALL. Dunst is phenomenal, she's the whole-ass movie! We've literally never seen this from her before, and damn, that range. One doesn't doubt her as Lee, a veteran war photographer, for a moment, even though she barely says anything. It's saying a lot that this is up there amongst her best work. Hell, it's one of the best performances of this whole decade. The whole movie plays out through her reactions and tonally she's pitched it perfectly. And Wagner Moura is almost equally brilliant (it could reasonably be considered a co-lead performance imo): his Joel is chaotic, wild, and hedonistic. The depiction of war journalists is so precise: the bizarre, adrenaline-fueling addiction that it seems to require. It's devastating. The film explores the ethics of reporting: where it ends is not stated, but it is clear. In Moura's scream, in Dunst's eyes, in Stephen McKinley Henderson's beautifully wise tone, and then in Spaeny's reverse-mirroring her idol's journey. The score was appropriately surreal, the needle-drops brilliant (deep cuts!), all the techs are undeniably in sync. None of this would've worked without this ensemble, and Dunst in particular. They're not just the characters: they're the whole point of the film.One might ask: How stupid does Alex Garland have to be to make a film so pointedly open to all the criticism? He knows people will call it \"empty\", lacking in a \"political stance.\" He knows people will find it bombastic, or that because we're thrown into the deep end, no amount of character shading and performance work will prevent people from saying things like \"thin characterization\". But Lee, Joel & Sammy (McKinley Henderson) are razor-sharp. Jessie (Spaeny) is the real enigma. I think for Garland, this setting was the only vehicle through which there might be an actual jolt, and he wasn't wrong. The setting is familiar *globally*: what better setting to choose than the icons of a global superpower most people in the world are familiar with? This might seem like a step too far as comparison but people across the world were just as shocked as anyone when the towers went down on 9/11. Why? Because they wondered: it could happen there too? Really?! Garland's somehow made a film that feels real enough to evoke that shock.I kept thinking with every second I would soon say it's exploitative. But this movie doesn't allow any feel-good triumphalism. It's dark & terrifying. This is the sheer dread and despair of war: there is no questioning that the film is staunchly anti-war: the cost of it all feels so palpable. The aesthetic of this film and the strong emotion it elicits-all clearly intended-is more than enough for me to run with. I would've definitely been annoyed if it had been too definitive. This is an anti-war, anti-exceptionalism film about the nature of telling the truth about war. It's a masterpiece, it just is.\n\n                    562 out of 1,022 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

California and Texas have seceded from the Union and Florida seems to be having a wobble too. The President (Nick Offerman) makes a speech assuring the rest of his country that they've nothing to worry about, but hardened photo-journalist \"Lee\" (Kirsten Dunst) and her cohort \"Joel\" (Wagner Moura) reckon that the conflict is quite likely to come to an altogether different conclusion. They bravely decide to travel the 800-odd miles to Washington DC to try and interview him. Their out-of-shape veteran associate \"Sammy\" (Stephen McKinley Henderson) thinks they are mad, but also wants in on the trip. Meantime, the enthusiastic young photographer \"Jessie\" (Cailee Spaeny) has managed to hook up with the team and so, rather implausibly, they agree to take her on this perilous journey. It's that implausibility that carries the whole thing as the completely preposterous scenario unfolds before us. No effort is made to fill us in on the cause of this warfare. Did the President seize power? Was he elected from a party these states didn't vote for? Are they just brutal and well armed revolutionaries? Then we have the ridiculous dialogue - usually from Henderson with his \"always take fuel when you can\" or \"this way only leads to death\" type profundities as the group travel through a remarkably stable, well fuelled and provisioned, nation where there's hardly the merest hint of mass migrations, fear or terror. Indeed, their blue \"Press\" helmets and a little bit of kevlar seem to render them immune to the deadly drama that they are supposed to be experiencing. Jesse Plemons makes a brief appearance - that actually leads to the only vaguely exciting part of this chronology, but otherwise it's all a bit on a non-event. Dunst starts off as a strong and characterful woman but that dwindles away and, well, I was just a bit bored as the denouement hoved into view with all the predicability of the sun coming up. It's bitty, episodic, unrealistic and populated with characters in whom I simply could not believe. Sure, maybe it's supposed to be outlandishly apocalyptic, but it reminded me for the most part of an episode of \"Falling Skies\" - only without the aliens. Perhaps it might resonate better with an American audience?

The portrayed factions on purpose don't map to any of the current sides. The idea (or claim of intent) is to make the viewer not be able to identify with either side.The sides are portrayed as ridiculous and without any good reason. In real life, there have to be strong reasons to go to fight. Even if they are lies or exaggerations. People fight to defend their own ethnicity/nationality/tribe, or to uphold or impose their religion/ideology, or to avenge lost ones. It has to be something very strong to overcome your survival instinct and risk losing your life.In the movie, journalists are portrayed as the good people who can't understand why the rest are fighting at all. This is the biggest lie of the movie. MEDIA is usually the main way people are stirred into war and conflicts. They define the ENEMY, they vilify it, and convince viewers the other side are non-humans (necessary to convince people to kill others). Any journalist who doesn't align with the MEDIA on either side is banished/cancelled. See how it's playing in both \"left\" and \"right\" media nowadays. Same happened in both world wars before.So this movie pretends to be impartial but it's a LIE. It wants to DEMORALIZE people to NEVER REBEL against tyranny.Like the ones fueling riots and later, once things get out of hand, cry \"why can't we get along?\". Media is evil.History teaches if there's unjust power grab to destroy a republic people should rebel or suffer the consequences for a very long time. And if most people are cowards, GTFO before it's too late. Suffer now or suffer forever as a serf, vassal, or slave.

Is their any form of \"story\" that people keep complaining about? Absolutely, but you'd be foolish not to see or notice it. The slow disensitization of one character in particular while trying ever bit to hold onto her humanity is what really got me.

                "Content": "Civil War doesn't really say much but it's got noble intentions as it shows the bravery and desensitisation that journalists have whilst succeeding as an anti-war film that uses the spectacle to disorient and shock rather than thrill. It's a lean and intense mid-budget film that proves less can be so much more.The core trio are surprisingly strong when it comes to depth and investment. Kirsten Dunst excels as a world weary reporter who's spent years trying to prevent this very outcome, Cailee Spaeny is incredible as the newcomer who's still really affected by what she witnesses and Wagner Moura is a lot of fun as the one in it for the adrenaline rush.Alex Garland's direction is excellent as he moves through a steady stream of disturbing imagery, utilising both deafening noise and powerful quietness. Every set piece is terrific, mainly thanks to the sound design which ensures every bullet fired has never felt louder or scarier. It's a real assault on the senses, especially in IMAX.\n\n                    200 out of 420 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Title": "An unfulfilled, superficial take on a rather deep, contentious topic",
                "Content": "\"Civil War\" is a dystopian thriller film written and directed by Alex Garland (\"Ex Machina\", \"Annihilation\"). Starring Kirsten Dunst and Cailee Spaeny, it is an unfulfilled, superficial take on a rather deep, contentious topic.In the midst of a second American Civil War, renowned war photographer Lee Smith (Kirsten Dunst) meets up with her team of journalists consisting of Joel (Wagner Moura) and Sammy (Stephen McKinley Henderson). After surviving a suicide attack in New York City, the group decide to travel to Washington D. C. in hopes of interviewing the President (Nick Offerman) before he is overthrown. As the group prepare to venture off, Joel allows aspiring young photojournalist Jessie (Cailee Spaeny) to accompany them on their lengthy journey, with whom Lee reluctantly decides to take under her wing. While the team drive through the war-torn states, Jessie soon learns from Lee that in order to become a credible photographer, she must overcome her fears in covering the carnage taking place right before her eyes.Regardless of your personal beliefs, there's no denying that we are currently living in one of the most politically divisive times in the history of Western civilisation. Not since the 19th century has there been so much hostility that one would assume if things continue to escalate, the American superpower could very well break out into another civil war. Considering how much technology has advanced over the past hundred years, things could certainly take a turn for the worse with the possibility of neither side emerging as the victor. The 2024 film \"Civil War\" deals with this hypothetical scenario from the perspective of the risk-taking photojournalists in a lacklustre manner that fails to do justice to its intriguing concept.In the first scene, we see the President of the United States practicing a speech he will be delivering as his State of the Union address to the entire divided nation. We watch as the President nervously stumbles his way through the words he will be using to assure the country that this conflict is under control, almost as though he does not believe everything he is about to say. It is then revealed that the President's words are nothing more than lies, as his adversaries are fast approaching Washington D. C. with the intention of taking the nation's capital for themselves. What was once the safe and dignified capital city of America is now shown to be a violent war zone, complete with gunfire, military vehicles patrolling the streets, and various bodies littering the landscape.Though this opening does begin the film on a promising note, it finds itself unable to maintain this level of curiosity for the duration of its runtime. Simply put, not enough is revealed about the President to make the audience believe that such a man could credibly stay in power among this huge war taking place. To the film's credit, there are some hints dropped throughout the story regarding what he has done, like how he apparently abolished term limits (he is now in his third term in power) and disbanded the FBI. Yet is it never properly explained how he is now in danger of being deposed from his position after so long. How did he suddenly lose this much support? Which political party does he belong to and which one wants him out? Why is he fighting this war with only a small amount of his staff to protect him? The movie never tells us.Soon after, we are introduced to veteran photographer Lee, whose graphic pictures taken directly on the field of battle have gained her worldwide notoriety. This attracts an admirer in the young Jessie, who aspires to work alongside her idol as the war rages on. While on their journey towards the nation's capital, Jessie becomes increasingly exposed to the very worst that the war has to offer, something Lee informs her is a necessary part of the job. It is clear the film is intending to show us just how much war can affect the on-site journalists as much as those actually fighting on the frontline, yet it never quite utilises this idea properly.For instance, the relationship between Lee and Jessie is decidedly two-dimensional. At no point did it ever feel like Lee really cared about Jessie beyond her being a mere work colleague. There is only one scene where it felt like Jessie was learning something from Lee about human brutality but it is quickly glanced over and never mentioned again. All the potential was there to have shown these two growing closer as student and teacher, yet the film squanders nearly every opportunity available. It's hard to become attached to these characters when the situations they are placed in add practically no emotional weight to the overall story, and in a film that is supposed to examine the impact of war on people, this is a major problem.In spite of these deeper issues, the film at least manages to get its wartime atmosphere right. Director Alex Garland places the audience right in the middle of the conflict, with the possibility of danger lurking around just about any corner. I especially enjoyed the way he shows Washington D. C. as a warzone, resembling early 2000s Baghdad rather than a safe capital city within modern Western civilisation. Soldiers patrol the streets, major monuments like the Lincoln Memorial are constantly under threat of destruction, and the President is reduced to hiding in the White House with limited protection from his staff. This is far from the clean cut image America has held onto for so long, having now descended far into chaos and disunity.Unfortunately, Garland falters in the world building aspect of this superpower gripped in a civil war, as there is little effort put into why certain locations adhere to one political belief over the other. In one scene, the group of journalists stop by a seemingly normal town that has chosen to remain neutral to this war, with its citizens going about their daily business like nothing is happening. Instead of exploring this interesting concept, the main characters merely use this town as a brief pitstop and quickly move on somewhere else. This raises many questions, like why did this town choose to stay out of the war? How have they avoided being attacked from outsiders for so long? How are they not suspicious of this random group of people suddenly appearing in their town? Yet more important plot holes that are glanced over and never properly addressed.Although their characters are woefully underwritten, both Kirsten Dunst and Cailee Spaeny try to make the most with the weak material given to them. Out of the two of them, Dunst is the biggest standout as Lee, whose frequent trips into the war torn locations of America have clearly taken their toll on her mental health. Here, it is shown that Lee has become almost completely desensitised to the bloodshed happening right in front of her, even barely flinching whenever a gun is fired in her presence. Dunst does a nice enough job portraying Lee's nuanced reactions to all this butchery, as this is nothing more than another day at the office for her.On the other hand, Jessie's young, naive attitude towards her future career prospect is something that ends up defining her character throughout the whole film. At first, she is so shocked by what she is witnessing that it causes her to vomit and miss the chance to take a great photograph. Like Lee, Jessie also becomes desensitised to everything she sees, and in the process her photography skills improve drastically. Spaeny shows Jessie's emotional state becoming less and less of a issue, trading general compassion for on-location experience. As mentioned earlier, I just wish the film had explored Lee and Jessie's relationship better, as it would have made things more interesting to see their dynamic expanded upon throughout the story.Given the current state of the world right now, it is a huge shame that a film like \"Civil War\" is unable to provide more than simply a curious look at how things could be. It has a lot on its mind about the future of America but it never expresses it in a manner that can leave a lasting impression. In my opinion, this concept would have worked much better as a miniseries rather than a condensed feature film, as this would allow for the necessary fleshing out of the characters and world building. Hopefully someone will run with that idea one day, because I would definitely watch that over this any day.I rate it 5.5/10.\n\n                    12 out of 18 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

I almost fell asleep because of how boring and out of place the movie was, only to be awaken by obnoxiously loud noises and music that are probably designed to keep peoples' attention throughout this poorly-made film.The entire movie is alike to a teenager playing a video game and driving around like crazy in the midst of shooting and explosions with no context whatsoever. There was no introduction, no storyline, no plot, and no meaning. With the hip hop music and obnoxious sounds playing whilst deceased bodies are displayed, I'm not sure whether I'm supposed to feel sad or upbeat, or just completely puzzled as to what the hell is going on. There's literally nobody to root for, because you don't know who any of them are.I left the theater feeling deeply unsatisfied and confused.

This isn't an easy watch-its stark portrayal of war's psychological and emotional impacts hits hard, making it a thought-provoking exploration that avoids sensationalism. The film's intense atmosphere is amplified by a fantastic soundtrack, which complements Garland's storytelling, creating a deeply immersive experience.The performances in \"Civil War\" are a significant part of its success. The actors bring a raw, visceral energy that breathes life into their characters, making each personal story feel real and urgent. Their ability to convey the complexities of fear, loyalty, and despair adds a profound layer of authenticity to the film. Garland steers clear of typical war movie clichés, opting instead to focus on personal stories that illustrate the broader devastation of war. This approach doesn't just make \"Civil War\" relatable; it intensifies the emotional weight of the narrative, allowing viewers to feel the profound moral ambiguities and losses faced by its characters. With its compelling narrative, poignant execution, and standout performances, \"Civil War\" is a gut-punch of a film, showcasing Garland's skill in crafting narratives that are as unsettling as they are impactful.\n\n                    140 out of 302 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away.\"Dune: Part 2\" is everything one could ask for from a film of its kind. As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise, it's been a long time since iv'e encountered this level of world-building and epicness. The plot and story development are carried out in an awe-inspiring manner throughout the movie, progressing at a precise pace toward a spectacular climax that is executed perfectly.Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time, and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high-budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does. The film received praise from many great filmmakers, the most notable being Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight Trilogy, Oppenheimer), who very accurately compared Villeneuve's achievement in this film to the \"Empire Strikes Back\" of the modern era.Would highly recommend to re-watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better, though it's not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self-contained. More specifically, one of the most prominent and impressive strengths of the movie is how it stands on its own without relying too heavily on the first part. Of course, for those who really want to enjoy the story, there's no real point in watching the second part without having seen the first one. However, even those who watched it a few years ago and don't remember every little plot detail will be able to catch up very quickly while watching the Pt. 2 and will understand all the important details-even the smaller ones. Non-ideally, even someone who hasn't watched the first movie at all will greatly enjoy this one, as it is very self-contained despite relying heavily on the first movie-an impressive and highly commendable screenplay effort by the writers.Timothée Chalamet delivers a very impressive and charismatic performance, to the point where it seems like this is the role he was born to play. Zendaya also gives a very good performance, with significantly more screen time than in the first movie. Austin Butler manages to be terrifying in the role of the villain, Rebecca Ferguson shines in one of the best performances of the year, and Javier Bardem surprises in a role that sometimes provides the comic relief of the movie. In addition to them, the film is filled with top-tier actors and actresses who all perform their roles amazingly.Hans Zimmer's score is masterful just as you'd expect, and one step up from the Oscar winning and Grammy nominated score of Pt. 1. Technical aspects such as VFX, Production Design, Sound, Editing, etc. Are all top notch and awards-worthy. The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine. Denis direction is impeccable, and the story is absolutely fascinating- continuing to develop characters from Pt. 1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters.In my personal opinion, the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect. While the first part was excellent, it mainly served as a setup and positioning of the pieces for the sequel. In \"Part 2,\" the story reaches its climax, with one of the strongest climaxes seen on the big screen in recent decades, befitting the complex work Frank Herbert wrote many years ago.I believe (and surely hope) this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season. Below-the-line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now, but I hope it will get some love in above-the-line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture, perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre in recent years at the Academy. As a big fan of the genre, unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period, maybe it's time for a movie like this to triumph once again.While the movie serves as a great wrap-up to the story introduced in Pt. 1, in my opinion it could serve as an even better set-up to a possible masterpiece in \"Dune: Messiah\", which I really hope will get green-lit soon.Don't miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX, since I believe it's an historic piece of epic-Fantasy/Sci-Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre.Extremely recommended.\n\n                    1,083 out of 1,407 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now. This is everything I love about going to the movies. Also, Hans Zimmer.For book readers, I'd say this one takes more liberties than the first, but they were changes I liked, some for the better even. For the most part, it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered. The biggest change being no time jump. Therefore, a certain character doesn't fully appear in the movie contrary to the book. Though, they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally.I know it's early in the year, but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Score, Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, Best Costume, Best Production Design, Best Makeup, and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress. I guess that's pretty much every category now that I've typed it out lol.\n\n                    786 out of 1,065 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

The emotional connection between Paul and Chani, so vital to the story, is completely lacking and unbelievable. The two main characters are good looking enough but has absolutely zero chemistry on screen.I am certain Zendaya is a fine actress in some things, but she has basically 2 facial expressions here, and the one she uses the most is a scowl directed at Paul. I found her to be the worst part of this movie.The final fight scene is short, choppy, and a mess. It felt anticlimactic and unfulfilling\nThe Harkonens are basically reduced to bumbling villainy almost cartoonish. The ending was super abrupt, and was so different from the book that it left me wondering what the filmmakers would do if they want to do a sequel.I want to reiterate that this isn't a bad movie. Villenue is great at creating a world that looks living and breathing, but he can't give life to individual characters.It is like he can't see the trees for the forest.\n\n                    495 out of 618 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil. Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd-Rautha, and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts.Overall, Dune: Part Two is an inspiring, visually stunning sci-fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth, adventure, and destiny on a galactic scale.

This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied. In De Villeneuve's hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about, both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the natures and missions of Paul and his mother. For example, in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing.Having left this essence out of the movies, they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience. A kind of secular, profane Dune. Still nice, but also a bit disappointing.\n\n                    241 out of 302 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Not to mention your ears fall off when their is a sudden explosion during the mumbling. Gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone, like George Clooney.Overall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first 2 hours. All the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly don't go to movies to be entertained. Between the acting of Zendaya, Dave Bautista, Austin Butler and Florence Pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting, assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any acting.It's time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not.\n\n                    222 out of 279 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

The supposed \"best scenes\" seemed to blur together in a haze of monotony, leaving me searching for a standout moment or two to cling to.While I can appreciate the efforts of the filmmakers and the ambition behind bringing such a beloved story to life, I can't help but feel that the overwhelming hype surrounding this adaptation is somewhat unwarranted. Despite its visual spectacle and star-studded cast, Dune 2 left me yearning for a deeper connection and a stronger emotional resonance that simply wasn't present.In the end, while the film may find its audience among die-hard fans of the franchise or those with a particular affinity for its themes, for me, it fell short of the lofty expectations set by its predecessors and failed to leave a lasting impression.\n\n                    115 out of 149 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

I loved the first movie and thought it would be an impossibly difficult task to surpass it, but Denis Villeneuve has once again proven himself as the most promising sci-fi director of this age. I find that this installment of the series picks up its pace quickly and reaches its peak near the end of the film. Contrary to the first film where most of the action was packed into the middle. Dune: Part Two displays a more relaxed tone from the start to the middle of the movie, however the mood shifts to match the occasion and finally leaves you somewhat distraught as the consequences of the character's choices surely lead to a path they cannot return from. The cinematography by Greig Fraser is once again fantastic the mixture of his naturalistic style and the sci-fi genre leads to a grounded universe while still retaining the wonderous and whimsical aspects of science fiction, each decision on how planets and characters are portrayed demonstrates the care and attention paid to how audiences interpret them, you understand the Harkonnen, the Emperor, the Fremen, the Bene Gesserit and the remnants of house Atreides in one look at the way they are shown. The score is once again sublime, Hans Zimmer once again proves himself as the definitive motion picture composer, his ability to craft larger-than-life scores with his ability to understand the differences between each character and culture present in this film is nothing short of perfection, recurring themes and motifs are present throughout the movie and paired with the visuals and the performances, which are also incredible, form a modern day masterpiece crafted meticulously by masters of their respective fields. Rebecca Ferguson, Timothée Chalamet, Javier Bardem, Austin Butler and Zendaya give wonderful performances, with the first three being standouts. Overall this movie deserves the universal praise it has received and might just interest those who didn't even enjoy the first installment of the series.\n\n                    224 out of 371 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

What really hit the mark for me is Austin Butler's performance, with his coarse voice and intense demeanor. In fact, the whole sequence on Geidi Prime was for me the best moment of the movies, with the bleak, oppressive lightning of a black sun. Science-fiction at its best.Alas, one aspect lessened my pleasure and it is Zendaya as Chani. I don't know why Hollywood insist so much into giving her femme fatale roles, but each and every time I didn't believe it; Instead of seing the character, all I can see is the same rather plain-looking actress, with her limited range. Maybe she just didn't found her niche yet.On the other hand of the acting spectrum, Bautista is under-rated as an actor here, offering an emotional, convincing performence. In fact nearly all actors were very good, up to par with the technical team. Those movies get better with every viewing. A solid 8 stars.\n\n                    15 out of 20 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

All viallians feel quite weak, bland, and never seem to pose any real threat. Bautista's character is a joke, Baron isn't threatening, and the new villian (being called as good as joker by some people) also feels very generic. The *new abilities* that Paul gets also feel too convenient and easy to get.2. Characters change a lot instantly, Jessica suddenly becomes this completely different character, and same goes with Paul.3. I can see how it may have to be rushed in the movie format, but the pacing could've been better.4. Paul is the prophesied prophet, and... That just happens with no surprises etc. In some ways, I think that was for the better, as it avoids the overdone struggling hero cliche, but I was prepared to feel tense for Paul, but never really felt that there was a reason to feel tense.Overall, it's a solid 8/10, it is a technical masterpiece if you look at cinematography etc., but as a movie overall, it's just another 'good watch' which is well worth its time, and that's completely fine.\n\n                    34 out of 51 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "From the time this movie has been released it has been described as one of the best sequal ever made,but I feel bad to say this; it's not.It is still a good movie but it is inferior to the first part.I haven't read the books and when i watched the first part it was so entertaining and when you know a director like Denis Villeneuev will also make the next part,your expectations increases multiple times.I can understand they have a book and they are making it according to the source material but still you don't feel that amazement or thrill like the first movie.For me the biggest reason is not hiring the writer of the first movie Eric Roth.He is a damn good writer and has written movies like Forrest gump,The curious case of Benjamin button and etc.I don't know the reason why he wasn't there for this movie. But surely thing might have been different if he was on board.They changed the color palette also from the first movie.it was a little bluish in the first part which suited it but here they changed it and it looks quite different.It goes on with slow story telling and becomes really fast paced in the last 30 or 45 minutes.I am not saying it's a bad movie but what you expect after watching the first part it's not at that level.Behaviour of characters was also one dimensional and wasn't explored properly. Maybe because they had to fill so many things in 2.45 hours of time.You know extended version of 4 hours would work for this movie because there is so much to add or explain.But as we know it would never come out.Rest acting,music, cinematography all are good like the first part.You will like it but after it will be over you will be left with a feeling of something missing out from it.Let's hope the next part would be much more thrilling than this one.I believe in Denis Villeneuev and he is one of the best director of our time and i will watch whatever he will make.\n\n                    43 out of 52 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "So look, Dune Part 1 by Denis Vilneuve was pretty decent. I'd give that one a 7ish. But part 2 was really pretty boring and lacked all of the gravitas you had in the first movie.Everyone in the movie is incredibly serious and every word they speak is extended by long close ups of their faces. It's really drab... And in the end I really didn't care about any of the characters. It was just scene after scene of people saying really serious stuff that ultimately is not believable or particularly deep.The music is faux epic and sadly doesn't lend any particular weight to what's ultimately a decent story told in a very boring way.I'd say the VFX is good - yeah... not bad. But the costumes and the battle scenes are also boring - like going through the motions.The film has a few good moments, but an epic sci-fi masterpiece of our time this film is not. The silly desert walks are pretty funny though! XD haha.\n\n                    96 out of 124 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

He just lived into the character of Murlikant Petkar.#VijayRaaz as Murlikant Petkar's coach was another remarkable performance. I had seen his comic version in Dream Girl, but a coach who is tough and lovable at the same time #VijayRaaz delivered his best.Kabir Khan when it comes to Ek Tha Tiger, 83 & Chandu Champion, the casting for the protagonist is always certain. His last 83 and now Chandu Champion, we could see the weightage is for a character not the star who portrays the character.Overall Chandu Champion will never disappoint you as the movie talks again of those Champions who never surrender to fail.\n\n                    8 out of 10 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

In several instances of Pritam's background composition late KK was missed.\n\n                    1 out of 1 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "Chandu Champion (2024) :\nMovie Review -Kartik Aaryan finally gets into character-driven zones with Kabir Khan's inspiring tale, based on the life of Padma Shri recipient Mr. Muralikant Petkar, aka Chandu Champion. What the film deminded from Kartik and Kabir was a full submission to the craft, as the writing was already good since Petkar's life was so inspiring. It usually happens that biopics are safer than fictional stories because they have more realistic sense and more inspirational stuff to offer. Chandu Champion has a champion-like story coming from Muralikant Petkar's life, well-handled by Kabir Khan as the storyteller more than a director. His direction can still be at fault for those flaws we see in the film, but as a storyteller, he completely wins.In the early 50s, kid Muralikant is taken to a Karad station to see Khashaba Jadhav as he returns from a historic Olympic win. Little Murali, unaware of things, decides to win the Olympic Gold Medal for India and enters Kusti ka akhada. Grown-up Murali (Kartik Aaryan) is teased as \"Chandu Champion\" by locals and is called Kaccha Limbu by his own coach. The perception changes when he beats the opponent Pahalwan in a fight that he was supposed to lose, and then he is ran out of the village, only to find a new direction for his career-the Army. In the Army, Murali is guided by Tiger Ali (Vijay Raaj) in the boxing ring and becomes a sensation at the Olympics. With Gold being so close to him, Murali loses his concentration due to the glamour and glitter around him and loses the final. In 1965's war, he is hit by 9 bullets but still survives, only to be left with paralyzed legs. Will he be able to complete his dream of winning gold for India?With a considerable amount of fiction and a tell-me-the-same-story kind of presentation, Chandu Champion feels inspiring but repetitive. Vijay Raaj asks Chandu, \"Kabhi suni hai aise stories?\" The entire fault of repetitive cinema lies here in this line. What can we do if the stories are so similar to each other? There might be hundreds of Muralikant Petkars all over the world inspiring millions to \"never give up,\" but in our Maharashtra, we only had one Muralikant Petkar, no? What's wrong with telling his story, even if it is similar to many others? This is where every director and screenwriter should work. They can define cinema through new lenses if they can summarize the same story in a different format, in different ratios, and in different ways. The ultimate truth should remain the same.Talking about flaws, I didn't get how a man who has run out of a village in Langot can directly go to an army camp and get admission. Don't they ask for any documents? Also, the fact that the glitter disturbs your concentration doesn't seem like a big conflict in movies anymore. Even if we think about the 1960s, Milkha Singh went through a similar conflict, so Petkar could have easily avoided that (in real life and reel life, both). Didn't his married life deserve that one chunk of screen space? Besides these, I don't think there are any major flaws in the movie. It's a very good story with a sortable screenplay (which could have been better if we look at how Bhaag Milkha Bhaag and Dangal were handled). Khan's storytelling reminds you of his own previous works, if you look carefully. In 83's last scene, you see little Sachin Tendulkar on his brother's shoulder, and here you see a little girl on her father's shoulder waving at Padma Shri winner Petkar. I must say, that flashback trick is older than Petkar's real age, so Kabir Khan really needs to improvise himself there.Speaking of performances, Chandu Champion entirely belongs to two people: Kartik Aryan and Vijay Raaj. Kartik finally gets to play a challenging role (since it's a biopic), which demands physical and characteristic changes throughout the narrative. He does well. But how well? Compared to his own previous works, I can confidently say that Chandu Champion is Kartik Aaryan's best performance so far. Yes, in some scenes he brings that old and natural Kartik to spoil the sculptor, but nothing damageable. No more rom-com mediocrity; no more of that chocolate boy tag anymore. He has destroyed that image at once. Vijay Raaj nails the role of Tiger Ali. He is bindass; he is fearless; he is hopeful; and he is funny too. Rajpal Yadav's role seems important but it has been showcased with a lot of mediocrity. \"Yayich hai\" and \"Apunich hai\" kinds of language didn't seem appropriate for the 1960s (for any character). Yashpal Sharma and Shreyas Talpade are wasted in cringe-worthy roles, while Ganesh Yadav fits well for that small role. I am not sure whether Bhagyashri Borse's role was really necessary here. A journalist being so close to contestants during lunch and practice sessions isn't plausible at all. Yet, she looked cute, and I personally wouldn't mind having such a lovely lady nearby (but it's cinema, and I am a critic after all). Talented Sonali Kulkarni gets a small role but does fine, as did the other supporting cast members.Chandu Champion lacks musical finesse. I don't know from where that \"Satyanaas\" song appeared. The lyrics and the tone did not suit the situation at all. \"Sarfira\" was okay, but those situations needed a much more inspirational song. The cinematography was good, the sound design was decent, and the production value was high. Kabir Khan has proved that he can't really make a \"bad film\" every time (except a few), and the emotional pull he has is much better than that of other directors (except Hirani). Chandu Champion isn't his best work, but it's not bad or average either. Most of the credit goes to Muralikant Perkar's life because the story he has to share with us all is just INCREDIBLE. More than Kartik and Kabir, I really want to meet this man and salute him for whatever he has achieved in his life. Kis mitti ka bana hai ye banda? I really want to find out now.RATING - 6/10*\n\n                    3 out of 7 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "Let me start by saying that watching *Chandu Champion* was a colossal waste of time and money. This movie is a prime example of everything wrong with Bollywood these days. From the cringe-worthy acting to the laughable special effects, there wasn't a single moment where I felt entertained or engaged.Firstly, the plot was as predictable as sunrise. A cliché story of an underdog trying to become a champion in some obscure sport (which they failed to properly explain). The screenplay felt like it was written by a middle-schooler who just discovered dramatic tropes and wanted to use every single one of them. The dialogues were so insipid that I found myself rolling my eyes more often than I blinked.Let's talk about the performances, if we can call them that. The lead actor, who seemed like he was pulled out of an amateur theatre workshop, displayed a range of expressions varying from confused to constipated. His attempts at emoting were so cringe-inducing that I started rooting for the villain, who was equally unimpressive with his over-the-top evil laughs and cartoonish gestures.And don't even get me started on the music. The songs were forgettable at best and ear-gratingly bad at worst. I swear, the background score was so poorly mixed that it felt like a cacophony of random noises rather than music meant to enhance the scenes.Special effects? What special effects? I've seen better CGI in YouTube videos made by teenagers in their basement. The scenes meant to be action-packed were just plain laughable. It was as if the filmmakers decided to cut corners by using outdated software from the early 2000s.To sum it up, *Chandu Champion* is a disaster of a film that should serve as a cautionary tale for anyone thinking of entering the film industry without a shred of talent or creativity. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.\n\n                    0 out of 4 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "\"Chandu Champion\" is a stirring cinematic portrayal of resilience and triumph against the odds, directed by Kabir Khan and featuring a standout performance by Kartik Aaryan. The film, which chronicles the life of Murlikant Petkar, India's first Paralympic gold medalist, captivates with its potent blend of drama, inspiration, and action.From the outset, the film sets a gripping tone. We first meet Petkar as he awakens from a two-year coma, a consequence of his injuries sustained during military service. This dramatic re-entry into consciousness is both haunting and hopeful, immediately drawing the audience into his tumultuous journey. The narrative then skillfully transitions to his childhood, where young Murli, fondly nicknamed \"Chandu Champion,\" harbors dreams of greatness.Kartik Aaryan's portrayal of Petkar is nothing short of transformative. Known for his roles in lighter, comedic fare, Aaryan demonstrates remarkable range and depth, embodying the physical and emotional struggles of his character with authenticity and intensity. His dedication to the role is evident in his physical transformation and the raw emotion he brings to the screen, capturing Petkar's indomitable spirit and unwavering determination.The screenplay, co-written by Kabir Khan and Neeraj Udhwani, deftly balances the various phases of Petkar's life, ensuring that each moment, whether triumphant or tragic, resonates with the audience. The film's pacing allows viewers to fully immerse themselves in Petkar's journey, from the initial ridicule he faces to his eventual rise as a national hero. This narrative structure not only highlights the personal and societal challenges Petkar overcomes but also serves as a broader commentary on the resilience of the human spirit.One of the film's strengths lies in its depiction of the socio-political environment of the time. The challenges faced by disabled athletes in India, particularly during Petkar's era, are poignantly portrayed, adding depth to the narrative. The film doesn't shy away from depicting the harsh realities of the prejudice and lack of support that Petkar faced, making his eventual triumph all the more inspiring.Kabir Khan's direction is meticulous, with each scene crafted to enhance the emotional and visual impact of the story. The action sequences, particularly those depicting Petkar's sporting events, are exhilarating and shot with a dynamic intensity that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. Cinematographer Aseem Mishra's use of close-ups and wide shots creates a visual narrative that complements the film's emotional arc, while Pritam's musical score underscores the film's dramatic and uplifting moments perfectly.The supporting cast, including notable performances by actors like Pankaj Tripathi and Ananya Panday, adds further depth to the film. Tripathi, in particular, shines in his role as Petkar's mentor, providing a steady, grounding presence that contrasts with Petkar's fiery determination. Panday's role, though smaller, is impactful, highlighting the importance of familial and emotional support in Petkar's journey.\"Chandu Champion\" is not just a sports biopic; it's a heartfelt tribute to a man who defied the odds and a celebration of perseverance and the relentless pursuit of dreams. The film's ability to inspire and evoke a range of emotions is a testament to the collaborative effort of its cast and crew, led by Kabir Khan's visionary direction and Kartik Aaryan's compelling performance.In conclusion, \"Chandu Champion\" stands out as a powerful, inspirational film that will leave a lasting impression on its audience. It's a must-watch for those who appreciate stories of grit, determination, and the human capacity to overcome adversity. This film is a testament to the extraordinary achievements possible through unwavering resolve and the courage to dream big.\n\n                    3 out of 5 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "Really wanted to like this. The previous trilogy is excellent, and I'd even say it's one of the best genre trilogies ever made (LOTR is #1, of course). Dawn is especially a masterpiece of intelligent sci-fi adventure spectacle, a movie that is both exciting and intelligent. The entire trilogy is emotionally engaging and Caesar is an incredible lead.Unfortunately, this film doesn't have any characters as good as Caesar. In fact, it feels like a lesser retread of the same ideas and themes of the previous trilogy. There's nothing really new here. You've already seen a better version of this movie before.With that said, let me get the good out of the way first. The cinematography is excellent. The visual effects are still incredible, both as a technical and artistic achievement. The first 45 minutes of the film are really solid. There's a lot of good visual storytelling in the opening act.However, once we meet the main antagonist, things kinda fall apart. The pacing is off. Some scenes drag, while major character moments feel rushed. There's a friction between two major characters that doesn't feel earned, especially since the characters kinda come to an understanding, and then a few scenes later they are butting heads. What could and should have been an interesting dynamic feels incomplete, like entire scenes were cut out.The main antagonist could have been really cool. The idea of a cult-like warlord obsessed with human history, there's so much they could have done with that idea. But he simply doesn't have enough scenes to really make him anything more than Koba Part II. And Koba had better motivations and more complexity. None of the characters here are as well written as the previous trilogy and the last 10 minutes feel more like a TV finale than a movie.Oh, and the music score is pretty generic and forgettable. Really disappointing, because I love the music from the other movies. Caesar's theme is so good. Nothing here comes close.Anyway... Kingdom is far from terrible, but to quote another major franchise with a movie coming out May 2024: \"Mediocre!\"\n\n                    217 out of 274 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "I'm bummed I didn't love this. The visuals are as good as ever, both from cinematography to cgi it just looks fantastic. Unfortunately it falls flat mostly everywhere else. A classic hero's journey through the remnants of this universe's apocalyptic landscape is a great idea, but the journey itself is just devoid of sauce. It's bland, and often just feels like we're watching scenes checking off boxes from an adventure story. Like a movie coming out of an assembly line. Character motivations are unclear, the mc's emotional arc is unclear, and overall every idea just doesn't feel fleshed out, even when they almost have a good one. How Caesar's legacy is handled in this movie is almost interesting, but again it is not fleshed out. I will say the movie starts strong, I didn't really start turning on it til I realized how bored I was about halfway through. And that's before the third act really just frustrated me. Almost feels like we're seeing the first draft of a potentially great movie. Still excited to see where the franchise goes, but this new set of movies is off to a rough start for me.\n\n                    96 out of 123 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "This movie is just about a worthy successor to the original set of movies from the 20th century.Like them, it uses state of the art special effects to wittily investigate contemporary questions of ethics, humanity, status and prejudice while distracting the popcorn crowd with an engrossing adventure of exploration, captivity and escape in a make-believe world that, in what is a strong science fiction tradition, is recognisably a few \"what if?\"'s away from our own.Unlike the original five movies, where each sequel was originally unplanned, this is clearly a new \"chapter one\", taking the time to introduce some elements that will feature in the upcoming sequels.Over and over it evokes the sense of wonder of the original handful, with plenty of specific visual, musical and thematic evocations. There are reognisable influences from the 1970s TV show and even some of the Apes comic book stories of that era. But, it is also unmistakably a post-Lord of the Rings epic, the influence showing up in how various action and travel sequences have been shot.While there is not nearly so much sly humour as the originals, the socio-historic themes are more nuanced, closer to the surface and harder to miss. Questions of defining civilisation in terms of laws are answered in a way that will ultimately resonate with modern audiences; a layered and varied spectrum of responses to enslavement is shown; and as expected, anti-monarchist revolutions will always play well in the USA.Non-Americans may roll their eyes a little at the very earnest equating of eagles with capital-L Liberty (one can't imagine Charlton Heston's sardonic and cynical George Taylor from the 1968 movie being very impressed), but on the plus side, Peter Macon's wonderful Raka just about matches the delightful charm of Kim Hunter's Zira and Roddy McDowell's Cornelius from the originals. Owen Teague also does a good job as Noa.The various fight scenes are competent without being overly thrilling (the most exciting action is a cornfield chase vaguely inspired by the original 1968 film), but the deeper probing into the various sub-texts and a fine selection of minor characters keeps the interest levels up. One could pick nits about some of the physics shown in the last twenty minutes, but it's hardly the first Hollywood film to sacrifice strict logic for spectacle and it surely won't be the last.Overall, this does a good job of working on several levels and should appeal to a good range of audiences.\n\n                    80 out of 121 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "I don't know if it's just me because in the past 52 hours I have watched all of the Planet of the Apes movies (excluding Tim Burton's horrible 2001 version) but it seemed to me that this movie was just OK.Taking place \"many, many generations\" after Caesar dies, an ape named Noa and his two friends are going through a rite of passage that has to deal with collecting hawks' eggs when an intruder comes into camp breaking the egg he has collected and was holding for the ceremony the next day. Therefore, he needs to go and collect another egg before said ceremony. While he is out, he runs into a band of apes hurting other apes and they track him back to his village, which they decimate and bring Noa's clan into servitude. Noa escapes and seeks out his family and comes across an orangutan named Raka, and they both encounter a human woman who, it turns out, can talk. They are captured and brought to the palace of Proximus Caesar, an evil gorilla who desires to have all apes under his kingdom.While there are many, many nods to the original 1968 film (including musical cues) and the movie had very stunning visual effects, the story itself was kind of lethargic when it wasn't in set piece mode.The acting - with a couple of exceptions - was just okay and this is an indication that future movies need a protagonist that meets the stature of Andy Serkis and Roddy McDowell. Owen Teague as Noa, is barely adequate and the same can be said for Freya Allen as Mae, the talking human. She obviously has ulterior motives, but her performance doesn't. The only three actors in the film that are worth mentioning are Peter Macon as Raka, the orangutan, whose motion capture seems to show his jovial good nature and charm, William H. Macy (yeah! That guy!!!) as a human who educates Proximus Caesar on human history and literature and who radiates the word \"collaborator\" and finally the great character actor Kevin Durand, as big bad Proximus himself. Durand, as he always does, radiates menace.There's no reason that this story could not have been accomplished in less than 145 minutes and it just seems that nowadays the name of the game is to make movies longer for the sake of making movies longer. This movie really dragged, not because of any poor story choices (because the story itself was decent), but because of poor choices in the editing room.I see where this movie trilogy is going and it's fine but is the next motion picture going to be two hours and 45 minutes long and the final movie in this trilogy going to be three hours long? These are Planet of the Apes movies - we're not the defining Pi. The notion that somehow longer is better is absolutely ridiculous.This is the worst of the reboot films since 2011Yeah, watch it because it's not horrible but it could give you a headache (although I may have a headache because I forgot my eyeglasses when I went to the movie theater but, thankfully, I sat in the fourth row and my eyesight isn't that messed up that I couldn't see)If you're into monkeys, WATCH IT - Otherwise, Skip it3/5.\n\n                    49 out of 69 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "I was waiting just to hear Proximus scream 'WHAT A WONDERFUL DAY!' from all the times I heard the trailer playing at the theatre. I really liked how the franchise once again showcases the humanity of the apes, like the touching funeral scene. It had breathtaking scenery throughout, especially the transformation of metropolitan cities into forests. I found it interesting how they introduced pets, a bird is an ape's best friend, essentially. I liked that we exploring their customs in the first act of the movie.While the film's length and the extensive world-building sometimes made it feel a bit slow, every scene served a purpose in the end, especially considering this's setting the stage for a new era in the Planet of the Apes movies. We get to see how the environment, the apes and the humans have evolved. I liked how the movie paid homage to Caesar without directly continuing his story; his legacy felt respectfully acknowledged. He had a good run and his story was complete.The premise of the movie, particularly the portrayal of the antagonists, reminded me of religious wars, where the apes resemble Christian crusaders using a historic figure's image to justify war and violence, a theme with deep implications. The movie addresses that but not in a way that will make you leave the theatre pondering. How teachings can be misconstrued.This installment's message felt more overt compared to the trilogy, almost as if the apes were portrayed as essentially human. The trilogy was always telling a human story through apes, it was always obvious but now the fourth installment is quite on the nose.Good time is spent with the characters, so when moments of sadness or goodbyes arise, we feel it too. It's slow paced but I was heavily invested. The scene where she calls out to Noah was amazing. Hearing an 'echo' speaking, was almost as shocking when Caesar screamed \"go!\" for the first time. Also was she essentially looking for an English textbook? Lol.While Noah is the lead character, there were instances where Mae took the forefront, causing some confusion about the movie's primary focus. She didn't feel explored or interesting enough but I loved Freya Allan's performance.It's a drama. It's not what I was expecting, I thought it'd me more action packed, but it's still good. It was different to my expectations the way \"War for the Planet of the apes\" also wasn't a full blown war as well. I also think this is the first movie since the trilogy started where earth was now actually a planet of apes. Humans clearly have been dominated.Following up on Caesar was always gonna be difficult, I think he was a beloved character and we got to see his whole journey. The new lead character Noah is alright, however, I didn't find myself super captivated by him. We got to see Caesar's full character arc, birth to death; while Noah is already a little older, coming-of-age age. His story is still interesting though.The conflict of ideas between Noah and Mae could have been more intense. There were times when I thought \"ouu this is about to be a big fight/argument\" and it's just meh. It wasn't as thought provoking as I would've liked. I liked Proximus Caesar though, I thought he made quite the enticing antagonist. Second most interesting character after Raka*.The ending hints at the possibility of another trilogy, laying a solid foundation for future installments. Overall, I liked it more than \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" but not as much as the sequels. \"Dawn of the planet of the apes\" is still my favorite. It's not as epic as I thought it'd be; I think it's more enjoyable if you're already into the franchise. It doesn't do anything terribly, I just didn't walk out of the theatre thinking \"wow!\" People were applauding a lot throughout the movie actually. There was a guy who sat close to me and blacked out before the movie started, snoring the entire time. Thought about not waking him up after the movie finished because everyone literally just walked by him. This dude bought imax tickets, large bucket of popcorn, large soda and some more snacks, all that just to sleep before the movie started. Anyway, I still enjoyed the whole thing, and very much looking forward to whatever's next.Also just found out it's directed by they who did maze runner movies and they actually both have such similar aura to them.\n\n                    62 out of 93 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "If someone would have said that 2 of the more emotionally rich movie going experiences of the past 6 months (or so) would have been a Godzilla movie and a Planet of the Apes film, I never would have believed you.But such is the case with last fall's GODZILLA MINUS ONE and the new KINGDOM OF THE PLANET OF THE APES. 2 CGI-rich action/fantasy epics that focus more on the emotional heft of the characters rather than inundate the audience with over-the-top, flashy CGI.Are you paying attention KONG x GODZILLA: THE NEW EMPIRE?Set \"many generations\" after the events of the previous 3 Planet of the Apes films, KINGDOM OF THE PLANET OF THE APES takes place in a world where the Apes (not man) rule the planet. It is set in what would be their \"Bronze Age\" where all the simian populations are living in clans and the concepts, teachings and philosophies of the original intelligent Ape, Caesar, is more myth than reality.Enter our hero, NOA (wonderfully played in motion capture by Owen Teague - the bully Patrick Hockstetter in the IT films) who is leaving a peaceful life with his family and his clan. Their clan of chimpanzees is overpowered - and thrown into slavery - by a clan of Gorillas led by Proxima Caeser (Kevin Durand - Little John in the Russel Crowe ROBIN HOOD film of 2010) - also ably rendered in motion capture. This sets Noa on a journey to rescue his clan aided by an Orangutan, Rata (Peter Macon - Bortus in the t.v. Series THE ORVILLE) and...gasp...a HUMAN (Freya Allan - THE WITCHER).It is this journey by this disparate trio that brings the emotional power to this film as the trio must decide to try to trust each other while also coming to grips with what their world has become.It's an interesting allegory that is subtle and does not try to preach or hit the audience over the head and the 3 actors (despite 2 of them being rendered in motion capture) form a compelling trio to watch.And...that is because this film is wrapped in an action/adventure CGI story that is a marvel to view. The motion-capture of the actors is superb - this technology has come a long way since Tom Hanks in THE POLAR EXPRESS and one forgets that one is looking at a rendering and not a real, flesh and blood actor - even if that actor is an ape.Director Wes Ball (the MAZE RUNNER films) does a very strong job of keeping the plot moving and the characters grounded while also dazzling with marvelous special effects and battle scenes that are well choreographed (you know where all the major players are and what their motivations are during the action). This helps to bring a very enjoyable summer blockbuster film to the cineplex - and you don't even need to have viewed any of the previous Planet of the Apes films to understand what's going on.A very pleasant surprise and I look forward to the next (11th) feature in this series.Letter Grade A-8 (out of 10) StarsAnd...you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)\n\n                    46 out of 68 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

While I liked the trilogy, I didn't think they had been quite the blockbusters to spawn another trilogy, and they had a sombre tone. Nevertheless intrigued, I went for the early screening not having even watched a trailer or read anything about it.First off, watch it on whichever premium format you can. The CGI is really well done from apes emoting to the dramatic terrains.I liked that the hero was a little diffident at first but grew with the story. Sure we've seen it a thousand times, but it was still an identifiable journey.The ideology splits were shown well, the action sequences were effective and the shades of characters kept me interested. Sure it left a few questions hanging, but I guess those are for the sequel(s).Pacing did feel slow at times but I like that personally better than nonstop effects and explosions. Mae was the more intriguing character, with Noa's arc (see what I did there) being a more predictable one. If you let yourself go on the journey, I think you'll enjoy it. No huge surprises in the story though - you'll know if you're gonna like it or not pretty much in the first act.

From the lush landscapes to the intricate ape society, every aspect feels meticulously crafted and immersive.But beyond the spectacle, \"Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes\" delves into deeper themes, exploring complex issues like power dynamics, societal structure, and the moral dilemmas that arise when different species coexist. It's a movie that not only entertains but also sparks meaningful conversations long after the credits roll.The performances are stellar across the board, with the cast fully embracing their roles and bringing depth to their characters.

It was beyond boring.The main plot consists of a rescue mission and a divide between characters. Aren't they the plots of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes & War of the Planet of the Apes put together? And somehow most of the film consists of the most uninteresting world exploration and character development. It was almost like they intentionally set the excitement bar low so the next film(s) can easily appear more exciting. If you're expecting an action packed adventure, maybe save your money instead. I wasn't necessarily expecting an action packed adventure, but I expected a bit more than one 5 min action scene. I would also expect to care about the story.War for the Planet of the Apes is on my 10/10 list, and for it to be followed up by THIS is insulting. When I saw Wes Ball was directing and Andy Serkis wasn't returning I knew it would be a disaster, when I saw the reviews I thought it might actually be good. (I know Serkis's Caesar isn't in the film but he plays an ape for Christ sake).This was clearly just a cash grab for 20th Century Fox which is receiving relatively positive feedback.

This is the first modern Ape movie shot without Andy Serkis, but it does star Kevin Durand (\"The Strain\"), William H. Macy (\"Shameless\") and Owen Teague (\"Bloodline\").Watch out for: One of the most iconic death by birds scenes since Alfred Hitchcock.Now I can't wait for the reboot of the '68 version where apes are reading, bearing guns, governed and all the crazy stuff that made this concept so fascinating to me as a youth.\"Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes\" has blown my mind.Its message is about how society functions better with decency, morality and compassion...valuable things that the OG Caesar taught his clan and passed on through many generations...because together we are strong as a society, not divided.\"Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes\" is like \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" with Apes and you're getting the big picture.What a wonderful day...to see a movie where you'll believe Apes can swear!\n\n                    33 out of 56 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "100% spoiler-free reviewI just watched this on 8 May 2024 in the ScreenX format. Does the format add something? Yes! Is it worth driving an extra hour for? Yes! Will the movie still be enjoyable in the more regular formats? Absolutely, the movie is worth it either way!As preparation for this movie. I re-watched the Ceasar trilogy Rise (2011, 2D), Dawn (2014, wonderfully, natively shot with 3D cameras) and War (2017, 3D added, partly in post) in my 3D-capable home theater. It is a very moving trilogy that I had not viewed in a while, a worthwhile re-watch. Is it necessary to understand this 2024 edition Kingdom? No, not at all. It will add depth to the experience, but the new story can be understood and followed without having seen the first trilogy.There is no 3D release of this new feature, Kingdom, unfortunately. No 3D version anywhere in the world, from what I found. In my country (Netherlands) it is playing in the premium formats Imax, 4DX (which is still 2D in this case), Dolby Cinema and ScreenX. I do my research and usually I tend to go for ScreenX if I have similar options to choose from. Why? ScreenX adds peripheral imagery that is specially shot for a selection of scenes, usually the scenes where the viewer can be immersed in the action or the environments. There are 5 or 6 long sections where the side screens are turned on. It is not an add-on effect created in post, there is actual additional, original footage to the left and right that you don't get to see in any of the other formats. There is also no way to see it at home yet, as far as I know, although it could be released for VR glasses, I imagine, similar to how Disney+ recently released Disney and Pixar 3D movies for the Apple Vision Pro.I am someone who avoids watching previews and trailers. I want to go into a movie with zero information about what I am going to see. I hate those spoiler-ridden trailers that give half the plot points away. So I am not going to say anything about the story.All I want to say is that this post-apocalyptic world is the most appealing that I can remember experiencing. It brings a totally different feeling than e.g. The Mad Max movies, Fallout, The Road or Akira. Even though there is something imminently sad about this possible future, it has an appeal that is comparable more to James Cameron's Avatar movies on Pandora. Where the Ceasar trilogy showed a not so distant future of earth, here we get to look around in an intriguing green world full of surprises.I am not very familiar with director Wes Ball's previous films, but he does a wonderful job following into Matt Reeves's (Dawn and War) footsteps. Yes, this is science fiction. Yes, it is a marvel of technology that we can be immersed into this world, but in the end it is a movie where you are swept away by engaging performances and story lines, not by special effects. Go see it, if you enjoy original, intelligent stories.\n\n                    32 out of 55 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Might be advisable to check your expectations on that front. That being said, the storyline was fine, albeit familiar. Honestly, how original can it get with a predetermined trajectory. It does lag in parts, which I personally thought could've been shaved off to keep the momentum going.I thought the cast did a good job, namely Owen Teague and Kevin Durand. Freya Allen's role could've been played by any actress, so she really didn't add anything spectacular to the movie. I liked the ape characters, not so much the humans. Which has been a thorn to every Ape movie.Somehow, this instalment didn't hit me like the Andy Serkis trilogy. The remarkability of the first 3 episodes was clearly missing here. Perhaps Serkis cast such a wide shadow that it's a tough act to measure up to....who knows? Durand's Caeser was awesome, but not nearly as captivating as Serkis' namesake.Still, it's a worthwhile watch. I'm certainly looking forward to a future instalment (if there is one), and counting on the storyline to improve as well. 7.5/10 from me.\n\n                    7 out of 12 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "I'm a huge fan of Godzilla, I think the original from 1954 is a genuine classic and a great film (not just a great \"monster\" movie). The Heisei era is my overall favorite, and I thought Shin Godzilla was weird in all the right ways. It was one of my favorite movies from that year.This one might be even better. You actually care about the characters. It deals with some very serious topics, such as survivors guilt and the aftermath of war violence on civilians and conflicting emotions around national pride and feeling betrayed by your government. Yet the film is also exciting and optimistic and has some of the best Godzilla sequences ever put to screen. My favorite depiction of Godzilla is as a force of nature, representing the power of the atomic bomb or the fury of war itself. That's the Godzilla you get here. I think this film can very favorably be compared to American classics like Jaws and Jurassic Park, too.I don't want to say too much, it's best to just experience the movie for yourself. The only part that felt a little false to me was the very end, but I understand why the director wanted to do it that way. The special effects look great for the most part, but there are a couple of shots here and there that aren't perfect when compared to some Hollywood movies. However, it hardly matters. This is an incredible film.9/10 easily, probably closer to 9.5My current Godzilla rankings:1) Gojira (1954)\n2) Godzilla Minus One (2023)\n3) Godzilla vs. Destoroyah (1995)\n4) Shin Godzilla (2016)\n5) Return of Godzilla (1984)Special mentions to GMK, Godzilla vs. Biollante, Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla (1974) and Mothra vs. Godzilla (1964)\n\n                    560 out of 633 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "I just saw the advanced screening of Godzilla minus one and I have to say I was very pleased with the final product. If I had any complaints about this movie it is just that the CGI Godzilla often looked weird similar to a video game. However when Godzilla looked good, it was very impressive especially in the water scenes.Unlike every other Godzilla movie I have ever seen this is the first Godzilla movie where I actually liked on the characters and the storyline actually made sense and touched the human heart. It showed what people were dealing with at that time which was directly after world war II and how people were suffering not only with the after effects of the war but also the trauma from being exposed to a huge monster destroying cities.Godzilla may be a fictional character but loss and tragedy are real, and people are dealing with it everyday.Overall I really like this movie and it is obviously a prequel to the original Godzilla movie that came out over 70 years ago. Once you see this movie at some point you will understand why.What I would really like to see since it is clear that there have been multiple Godzilla's at some point in time is some type of legitimate crossover between toho and the American studios who are producing Godzilla monster verse in America. Last thing I or any fans want to see is a competition on who could spit out different and unique Godzilla's in two different countries.Since this is a Toho and Japanese produced movie, it would have been nice to have some of the theater edition Godzilla toys for sale like they do in Japan on every release.\n\n                    221 out of 260 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Director Takashi Yamazaki's Herculean efforts of reviving the Kaiju franchise is effortlessly awesome and absolutely top-tier filmmaking with the origin story of the gigantic monster showing up off the shores of post WWII Japan as it engages a full-tilt invasion of Tokyo and its environs with atypical destruction and death. Key to the film's strength is the plot involving ex-kamikaze pilot Kamiki (suffering arguably cinema's most poignant PTSD) and love interest Hamabe as a make-shift family attempting to survive with the thread of a palpable redemption narrative laced with surprisingly heartfelt emotion. The clean visual f/x propel the radioactive creature is jaw-droppingly astounding with some neat extras (his spiny back igniting as it re-charges its nuclear energies is eye-poppingly epic).

                "Content": "This is an enjoyable film to watch, and if you're on the tail end of its theater run or considering if it's worth streaming, the short answer is it's worth seeing. I do feel like among certain fan circles the movie is slightly 'overhyped' but that doesn't make the movie bad, it is in fact quite good. I think the exploration of the main character's relationship with kamikaze piloting, and in turn both Japan's historical understanding of that phenomenon as well as the West's, is actually still more poignant and worth exploring than perhaps we might be inclined to give it credit for. It's hard to overstate how culturally significant the kamikaze pilots were during and in the immediate aftermath of World War 2; although we had Oppenheimer to remind us of the cultural impact of the bomb, for soldiers that lived during World War 2, it was the stories of the kamikaze pilots that left a huge impact, even for people not in the Pacific theater. Likewise, Japan has long struggled to articulate its historical relationship to kamikaze pilots, with the memorial there being a kind of hot-button issue for multiple decades now. This film perhaps doesn't offer a searing insight, but rather a kind of wishful alternate path to how Japan and the west feels about kamikaze pilots. I think what's particularly remarkable about this film, frankly, is the way it pushes against the grain--a lot of Japanese cinema, especially that designed for view by western audiences, tends toward a construction of victimhood due to the bomb. This film tries to grapple with the echoes of imperial desire both immediately after the war and, perhaps, now.Honestly, come for the big cool depiction of Godzilla, but leave with a reflection of Japan's relationship to World War 2.\n\n                    53 out of 69 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

If the atomic bombing of Japan was the countries lowest point in history (\"0\"), then the emergence of Godzilla puts them lower (\"-1\").As many have mentioned, this movie goes back to Godzilla being the bad guy versus a hero/antihero that Hollywood has been making in the last 10+ years.Unlike more recent Godzilla movies made in the US, the human story is very specific on how to deal and overcome Godzilla and the aftermath of WWII, which is good; not too overbearing as other Godzilla movies with the human element to it.If you can ignore the Japanese only speaking and some bad CGI (here and there, not too bad), then this is a good movie to go see during a thin month (Dec 2023) of blockbuster movies.My biggest criticism, wished the hospital scene was more dire or devastating (you'll know what I mean when you see the film).And yes, there is a post-credit.\n\n                    115 out of 133 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "How many monster movies come with substantial critical claim attached? I was intrigued, even though I've never seen any of the classic Godzilla films. You won't regret seeing the film, but I didn't walk away feeling like I'd just watched the film of the year either.Godzilla Minus One follows the story of a kamikaze pilot who aborts his mission and lands on a small supply island. Later, Godzilla emerges and wipes out nearly everyone. Haunted by his actions, both in failing to carry out his mission and failing to act in saving the others on the island, the pilot returns to Tokyo and attempts to rebuild his life. Before long though, Godzilla reemerges and he feels compelled to join the defense of Tokyo.It's a good story, and there's an endearing human element to it all. The movie's not short of political commentary either, whether in subtext or unambiguous comments from the characters, ranging from views of honor and duty, criticism of the government, or even Japan's diminished autonomy in light of defeat in WWII. Notice that no government really does anything in the movie. The U. S. is sidelined because of concerns over raising tensions with the Soviets; the Japanese government is unable to act. Instead, it's the people themselves who have to act and save themselves.Towards the end, the film veers harder and harder towards melodrama, which detracted from the nice balance of seriousness and humor that had been present throughout the first several acts. Maybe it's a terrific Godzilla film; I can't speak to that. (This reminds me of the 007 films. There are \"good\" Bond films that still aren't good movies.) I can say that this Godzilla is a good movie and worth your time.\n\n                    64 out of 88 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "This short review is to help readers living in Western countries decide whether Godzilla Minus One is worth watching.There's three things you need to know beforehand so you won't be disappointed:1) The movie is in Japanese but has English subtitles.2) CGI is pretty bad (although I actually prefer costumes and prostethics more than 100% computer graphics. I'd rather Godzilla looks like this than the CGI in 'The Marvels' for example).3) The movie is dialogue heavy. Godzilla scenes are few and far between. That's how they kept a low budget - by giving you 5 - 10 minute snippets of Godzilla and then it's back to lengthy scenes of dialogue in Japan.Wrong expectations are probably the biggest reason for how divided the audience reaction has been.Keep in mind that this movie had a 9-point-something score on IMDb before it was released in Western Countries. By East-Asian standards this is one of the best movies of all time. So there's a clear distinction between how the movie has been received in different regions of the world.Being from the UK, my biggest gripe with Godzilla Minus One is that with a $15 million budget you would expect it to have far more substance than style. I was expecting top tier, edge-of-your-seat drama to compensate for what the movie lacked visually. But that wasn't the case. The plot was incredibly basic and predictable. It thinks it's deeper than it is.So overall you're left with a movie that doesn't look great, doesn't showcase Godzilla doing much (just slowly walking around, stepping on people, knocking over buildings and hurling ships) and doesn't have much substance either.On the below scale...5.

                "Content": "Set at the end of World War 2 and Japan is defeated and in ruins. Our protagonist is Koichi, a pilot who returns to his devastated hometown in Tokyo. He is unwelcome and guilt ridden for sneaking out of a kamikaze raid in the pacific. Japan is at its lowest point and then Godzilla arrives.This is a brilliant setup for this period story that sees a country without the military might, technology and morale to face this new enemy. The film also leans into the drama and emotion that made the first film so iconic and sets it apart from the family fun films of the 70s and 80s as well as the recent American blockbuster treatments. My Japanese is not good enough to understand all of the film so there will be lots that I didn't get. However it manages to be a strong, emotional story with a scary and ferocious Godzilla. In my mind it is far superior to Shin Godzilla which I found dull and goofy. This is the best Godzilla film in many years and perhaps the best since the 1954 original.\n\n                    182 out of 220 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

This Godzilla makes things personal by actively attacking the humans. The movie had great pacing where it doesn't feel like it's going on for too long and it was nice to have a darker story set after WW2. It really goes back to the franchise's roots. There's so much to say but it would give a lot away JUST SEE THE MOVIE ON THE BIGGEST SCREEN POSSIBLE 9/10.\n\n                    192 out of 233 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

The Human characters were very well written, the acting was outstanding, the emotions were strong with loss, pride and hope. The main cast were perfect together as a group, even the minor characters were amazing. The music, Oh My God the Music was conducted to fit every scene it was in and the OG theme was incredible to hear in a Dolby theater for the first time. Akira Ifukube would be proud, May he Rest In Peace. Lastly it was very educating in a way to see what Japan was like immediately after the War following the Atomic Bombs. The hardships they went through just to rebuild was very emotional to watch, but the way they climbed out of that pit of hopelessness would inspire any viewer to the franchise both Long Time along with Newer FansNow to the matter at Hand, the Star Himself, GODZILLA.The King of the Monsters is more terrifying in this movie than any other in the 69 year history of the Longest running franchise in the World! Every time he appears on screen he strikes fear into your very soul and leaves you in Awe at the same time. His destruction was unrelenting, the action out of this world, his Power Godly, his portrayal Very Real. At times you almost feel sorry for him because what's happened to him wasn't his fault. I haven't seen a monster movie this well done since Peter Jackson's King Kong (2005) and Cloverfield (2008).My solid review of this movie is a 10/10, and I recommend save notifications of any kind for when this movie hits the Home Media market because I sure will.Honestly I don't think I've ever watched a movie this perfect beforeLast note, The Whole Theater shook everytime Godzilla took a Step and my very bones were vibrating from his Roar\n#godzilla #godzilla1954 #godzillaminusone #monster #japan.\n\n                    146 out of 185 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

It's no doubt thanks to all new creators' mindset to try to outperform the previous works, based on and standing at the established brand \"Godzilla\". All the successors can benchmark the prior ones and analyze their successful points and failures. Yamazaki learned a lot from Anno's work and made some improvements and corrections particularly on the point that it couldn't catch on overseas. One of them is the music. He succeeded in taking on Naoki Sato, who is the graduate of Tokyo university of the arts, paying respect to the alumni and predecessor Ifukube and understanding his music deeply. In this film, vision and music are fantastically synchronized. And of course, the main character is Godzilla, but Yamazaki has done well in letting him act simply as a fearful object. Therefore, we can empathize fully with characters competing with Godzilla. Yamazaki who has suffered a streak of bummers in making films looks to be recovering his confidence, and is expected to deliver another sequel of Godzilla film, in which we can see a \"real\" duel with monsters like Ghidra or Mothra.\n\n                    127 out of 166 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

The humans are at the heart of the whole thing, and it all feels different being set in the 1940's and feeding off World war 2. While respecting the original Japanese movies with its stylish music. The effects are also great with some of the water stuff looking particularly cool.But it could of done with a bit more action and Godzilla looks a bit wonky at times. There's alot of chat in the movie which is mostly good. Until it goes on a bit long after the main attack at the centre of the movie.

                "Content": "If you love the classic Godzilla movies, go see this movie, you'll think it's awesome. Everyone else who's over 18 is going to feel like they've wasted their time and money on something which is no better than a made for TV movie.The CGI, albeit detailed, is laughably bad and obviously CGI each time you see it; The lighting/shading is all wrong. It would look great in a modern Anime, or something where everything is in CGI, but not this. The only good thing about this movie was the acting, and only if you are used to the acting in older Japanese flicks, where it's a bit over the top and sappy at times, but it felt like everyone was acting in-period together, and really helped set the tone for the movie's classic look and feel.Other than this, everything about it was rubbish. The storyboard and cuts were nonsensical and felt disjointed and abrupt. There was no seamless flow between scenes or parts, which made it feel amateurish like a pilot of a new TV series sometimes is. Don't even get me started on the cartoonish looking Godzilla, with it's undersized head, googly eyes, and baby t-rex like arms. As if the CGI wasn't bad enough, the director decided to make Godzilla look like a joke on purpose as homage to the original, but it just made me unnerved to watch. It's not scary anymore because of this; the fear wasn't there for me because of the poorly executed cgi, lack of build-up to destruction scenes, or enough shots of Godzilla doing anything.I can't believe the same director thinks he's good enough to shoot a Star Wars movie because of the feedback he's getting from this movie. Please don't.Also, save yourself some time and grief and don't go see this movie. I was seriously embarrassed to bring my partner to this after reading all the hype. You can't trust ratings for movies anymore until they've been out for long enough, and definitely not ones with a cult following like this. This movie is a sold 4/10, seriously. It's just not very good.\n\n                    129 out of 351 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Let's look at what Hollywood has put out (with my rating):Godzilla (2014) - 7 stars.Kong: Skull Island - 5 stars.Godzilla: King of the Monsters - 3 stars.Godzilla vs. Kong - 4 stars.Aside from the 2014 version, all of my reviews mention decent action surrounded by a terrible movie. But I can't remember a single action scene from them. Comparatively, the action scenes in Godzilla Minus One are INCREDIBLE. They are fully memorable and had my jaw dropped as far as it would go.BUT... this movie is 90% drama, only 10% Godzilla scenes. So you will fail unless you have a great story with fully developed characters and arcs, with full investment in those characters, with deep themes of trauma and remorse, and with emotionally powerful setups and payoffs.Who in the world would have expected that to be the case.This movie isn't just BEASTLY, it's sooooo good. Nearly every filmmaking aspect is well-done.Hollywood, please learn from this.

In many Godzilla movies, the creature is cartoonish at best. Not this Godzilla. The monster is the best and most fearsome Godzilla of all-time. Although it does cover the post-war period in Japanese history as the original did, Godzilla Minus One takes a different approach to the story. This film should be nominated, if not win, the Oscar for Best Picture.

It's a neat story and they made the telling of it fun. Thankfully it isn't goofy. It's not nonstop jokes, but it has a good sense of humor and I heard a good bit of chuckling in the theater throughout the movie, much of it coming from myself.You can tell Cavill had fun with this role. He shows off some range as his character is very different from the brooding muscle man that many people associate him with. It was delightful watching him do comedy. I haven't seen much of Alan Ritchson's work, but it was easy to see why he has such a growing fanbase. He's the muscle in this movie and proves to be a great action star. The whole cast is great and they give us a lot of fun characters.Action-comedies seem to be Guy Ritchie's specialty. He maintains a good balance of action and comedy and works so well with large casts as he lets every character feel like they matter to the story.\n\n                    162 out of 241 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Not a lot was asked of this talented cast. Also, as often happens with ensembles, we really only get to know our characters on the most superficial level. (Ensembles need franchises to tease out individuals' personal stories). Hard to be invested in their survival.And finally, what a waste of Henry Cavill. Cavill has a great face for this sort of role. Smirks, frowns and grins were swallowed up in a curiously overgrown mustache and beard. Why hire That Face and then hide it completely? Similarly, he spends the entire film, bundled up in multiple shabby layers of clothing. We're they trying to hide his physique so he wouldn't look too much like his costar Ritchson? Not a problem as Ritchson has at least 3 inches and 25lbs of muscle on Cavill any day of the week.They could have hired any one of a dozen other actors for the role if they didn't plan to let us SEE Cavill. And paid a lot less for them.I came away annoyed by the promise of Cavill unfulfilled and by a storyline that wouldn't have made for an interesting episode of The A Team.But Alan Ritchson was great. He clearly had way more fun with this character than he gets to have with Reacher.\n\n                    81 out of 123 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Title": "Great Guy Ritchie Insanity",
                "Content": "Guy Ritchie's \"Ungentlemanly Warfare\" is based, kinda, on the true exploits of Britain's Special Operations Executive (SOE) during World War II. Unsurprisingly, given Ritchie's involvement, liberties have been taken with the story.The SOE existed to operate behind enemy lines, committing sabotage and various other acts considered ungentlemanly by the upper crust officers who ran the conventional army. In 1942, England was starving and its army could not be resupplied because German U-boats owned the seas. With the blessing of Winston Churchill, the commander of the SOE sent a team to destroy the Duchessa d'Aosta, a supply ship that supplied all the carbon dioxide filters for the U-boats. These filters permitted these submarines to remain submerged for prolonged periods. By disabling the supply ship, the U-boat fleet would be effectively sidelined. The mission was labelled Operation Postmaster. It took place in January, 1942. This story centers on the real characters - Gus March-Phillips (Henry Cavill), Anders Larssen (Alan Ritchson) and Geoffrey Appleyard (Alex Pettyfer) - who were sent to complete this mission. In this film, some totally fictitious characters and other amalgamations of real-life participants also tagged along.\"Ungentlemanly Warfare\" contains all the satisfying flourishes of a film by Guy Ritchie (\"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,\" \"Sherlock Holmes,\" \"The Gentlemen\"). This film is cool and stylish. It's filled with swaggering characters spouting cheeky dialogue. There are flashbacks to keep the moviegoer off-balance. There are first-rate set pieces/action scenes. Oh, and there's violence - lots and lots of violence, most of it gratuitous. Did I mention the violence? The entire package is delivered with a manic gleefulness that's contagious.While the story is \"based on true events,\" reality is just a jumping off point. This film suggests that a major role of the operation was to persuade an officially neutral US to enter the war and begin helping Britain. Pearl Harbor occurred the month before, so the US was already fully engaged. The film also suggests that by disabling the supply ship, the SOE's mission could change the course of the war. While the events depicted in \"Ungentlemanly Warfare\" were not unimportant, a bigger factor was the development of RDX, an explosive powerful enough to sink the U-boats in the open sea.The film offers an interesting side note. One of the staffers for the SOE depicted in the film is a young officer named Ian Fleming (Freddie Fox). Yep, that Ian Fleming. His boss was known as M. In his James Bond novels, Fleming incorporates the character of M. Fleming has noted several times that the character of James Bond was based on Gus March-Phillips.To summarize, the cast here is charming and appealing, in no small part because they appear to be reveling in their madcap roles. Some of the location shots (much of the movie was filmed in Antalya, Turkey) make the film as worthwhile as a NatGeo documentary. The \"true story\" is a muddled mess. And there's the violence, lots and lots of violence. (Historical note: no one was actually killed during Operation Postmaster, although one Nazi soldier fainted at the sight of the intruders.) Guy Ritchie's energy and enthusiasm, which permeate this piece, will win over a lot of the folks in the seats.\n\n                    84 out of 129 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

There are a few scenes that felt very Tarantino-esque in its hyper violence or intensity, but likely couldn't be taken further because of the limitations of a true story. While not mad at the casting, they could've skipped on giving Alan Ritchson the crappy danish accent. And when Eiza Gonzalez's character's ethnicity is introduced, you'll probably raise an eyebrow considering she's a Mexican actress.\n\n                    72 out of 117 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "It's the true WWII story of Operation Postmaster. This Guy Ritchie movie is most definitely highly fictionalized. It's 1942. Britain is in its darkest hour. The Blitz is destroying London. U-boats are cutting off the Atlantic supply route. America remains on the sidelines. The Nazis' main U-boat supply ship is located in a neutral Spanish colonial west African port. British parliament refuses to attack a neutral country. Winston Churchill secretly orders the unauthorized mission led by imprisoned soldier Gus March-Phillips (Henry Cavill) with his motley crew of outsiders.This is one of those real fake history movies. It's more than the normal fictionalization. It's got the wild sardonic Guy Ritchie humor. These characters are rather one dimensional with a few exceptions. It feels more like a comic book movie although that's fine since that's the intention. A highlight is the insanely gorgeous Eiza González. Alan Ritchson and his giant muscles seem to be popping up everywhere. I like this, but I don't love it.\n\n                    22 out of 32 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

The plot is straight forward and allows for a talented cast to stretch their legs.I certainly hope this movie leads to larger action roles for Ritchson who has been stellar to date.\n\n                    84 out of 150 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "Cinemark has brought back its Secret Movie Series, and having never been to such an event before, I found myself intrigued and, for the low price of $5, I simply couldn't resist buying a ticket. I was one of six people in the theatre - clearly, a secret movie experience is a hard sell. However, I was excited at the prospect of watching something without knowing exactly what it would be. And after the trailers concluded, the lights dimmed and the film began to roll - to my delight, the secret movie was \"The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare.\"As a Guy Ritchie fan, after having seen the trailer for this movie, I knew I wanted to see it - although, admittedly, I didn't think the trailer was especially striking. However, I like Ritchie, and I love Cavill, so I was pleasantly surprised at the reveal of this film being the secret movie. And you know what? This is actually a pretty fun flick.Yes, there is nothing too innovative at play here - this is standard Ritchie fare, except more nuanced and less extreme in its directing and editing choices than, say, Ritchie's King Arthur film. \"Ministry\" plays out more like a typical action adventure movie with flares of Ritchie's signature style coming out here and there; and this more subdued approach actually works to the movie's advantage to highlight some of the more dramatic and intense moments. But if you're going to see this film, you're most likely going to see it due to the action that the trailer promised you. And how is the action? In a word: Great.My only complaint about the violence in this film - not to sound too bloodthirsty - is that it is surprisingly bloodless for an R-rated movie. I was really expecting something akin to Quentin Tarantino, with huge spurts of blood and gory deaths, but Ritchie, once again, takes a more subdued approach, choosing not to showcase a lot of blood or grisly images. That said, the action in this movie is still FANtastic, playing out an intensity that is simply missing from most modern action movies. There are plenty of shootouts - both with guns and with arrows; there are knife fights and axe battles; there are hand to hand combat sequences; basically, all of the WW2 action you can imagine is in this movie, and it's filmed wonderfully, without shaky camera or quick cuts. Sure, I would've preferred a bit more blood when Nazi's were punched or shot or sliced, but I can't knock Ritchie for choosing not to include that for the sole reason that the action is filmed so freaking well. It's nice to watch an action movie that has two things: 1) a lot of action and 2) clearly filmed action. Luckily, \"Ministry\" has both of those things, and because of that, will be sure to satisfy even the most jaded action junkie.In Ritchie films, both the plot and the actors are always standouts, and it's no different here in \"Ministry.\" Cavill and his band of ungentlemanly warriors are all super entertaining to watch, their chemistry leading to many laugh out loud moments. Additionally, the plot - as IMDB puts it, \"a small group of highly skilled soldiers strik(ing) against German forces behind enemy lines during World War II,\" offers a lot more meat to chew on than you might expect. There are a lot of things happening concurrently, which leads to storylines converging in a pretty satisfying way. There are also a few unexpected moments that force the plot to go in directions I didn't expect, but certainly enjoyed watching. The plot isn't anything phenomenal, but it kept me engaged and was a great vehicle for its characters and action.\"The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare\" is a good time at the theatre. This doesn't necessarily offer something that you haven't seen before, but in a genre as tired as WW2 action is, \"Ministry\" shakes things up just enough in terms of its colourful characters and explosive action that you can't help but have fun watching this. And if you're a fan of Guy Ritchie? Then going to see this is really a no brainer.\n\n                    55 out of 103 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

If you like movies based on Historical events, that seem to also show the connection between new film franchises, and old, this is a pretty good film for that.You have Henry Cavill walking through the entire film, with zero sense of urgency. You have the poor man's Gal Gadot, who does nothing but act as eye candy and a distraction to both the on screen talent, and the audience. You have Alan Ritchson who more or less steals the entire film as the lunatic killing machine. Honestly everyone does a decent job but frankly you could have cast anyone in this movie and it would have turned out the same.I like some things I have seen by Guy Ritchie, but this movie is a little less interesting because everything is so bland and safe. Visually, it's okay. It's not great. There were some good moments in the movie and some funny things that happen, but you can see where the moment lingers and the tension is not there at all. That's the thing. I did not feel one bit of tension for anyone at any time in this movie.That's the real sad part about this film, as you don't care about anyone before, during or after things get rolling. There's no air of menace to any of the bad guys, there's no chemistry between any of the characters. You see some glimpses but it's one scripted scene after another and there really is no acting.Why should I expect more?

However, I also like the movies not to be just a bunch of worn out tropes and cliches loosely stitched together without any sense, and this movie is exactly that.There is very little good about it, but plenty of bad. The script, although based on a true, and supposedly interesting, story, is horrible, making for an uninteresting and completely unbelievable viewing. The protagonists are basically an indestructible bunch of superheroes, that cannot be harmed by any means, and destroy enemies by merely looking at them. They loosely wave their weapons in the general direction of the enemies and the enemies all die, apparently killed by self guided smart bullets.The British government and military is supposedly full of traitors, defeatists and collaborationists, except for maybe two guys and the superhero team. Also, we are never given a satisfactory reason why they would be so vehemently opposed to the mission. Maybe because it was so \"ungentlemanly\" and the British are such gentlemen (if being a gentleman means stealing other nations' lands and resources and killing the native people, while saying \"sir\" and \"good morning\" in a very stuck up way).There is zero tension. Fake, \"insurmountable\" obstacles are introduced every couple of minutes, only to be resolved seconds later without any effort. By the time it happens for the second or third time, you don't care at all, because you know that it doesn't mean anything.There is no character development, no originality. Protagonists are the best at everything. The main villain has zero personality, zero originality, zero... anything. He is super evil, the end, and he basically does nothing for the whole movie, except existing in a very evil way.Alan Ritchson's character is supposed to be 22. Ritchson can't pass as a twenty-something by any stretch of imagination.The obligatory femme fatale is a paper thin stereotype, the best looking, the smartest, the coolest. She is also a crack shot that hits every target with the aiming technique that would not enable her to hit the side of a barn from two steps away. She is also supposed to be British-German-Jewish, but the actress is Mexican and looks it.The movie is also filled by meaningless scenes of empty and stupid dialogue that is supposed to sound deep and smart but instead just pads the run time. The action scenes, on the other hand, are too cartoonish to be taken seriously, and not funny enough to be considered comedy.I kept watching hoping that it would get better, but it stayed flat and boring until the end.\n\n                    211 out of 275 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

With this nice ensemble and decent budget, great production design, and a director who in theory definitely should have the chops, THE MINISTRY OF UNGENTLEMANLY WARFARE had everything it needed and more.And yet, it misses the mark. Much of it has to do with the direction, I'm afraid. A lack of spirit and inspiration can be felt throughout the film, sometimes worse than other times, but neither the shots he called nor his direction of the actors are worthy of Ritchie's potential. The script could have used a bit more polishing, especially concerning the dialogue, but it's really mostly the practical aspects where this falls flat.If you're a native German speaker, you will also notice how bad the fake Germans actually are. They should have been dubbed, but nobody seemed to care. Even Til Schweiger messed up some lines in German (probably drunk on set, as usual) - nobody cared.What also made the film worse than it could have been is the score. Someone told the composer to go for \"Schifrin meets Morricone\", I guess, and what he delivered was a weak attempt at copying both. No swing, no drama, no feeling whatsoever. Just flat and boring, matching the direction perfectly.That being said, you can still kill a bit of time watching this, since Cavill, Ritchson, et al are very likeable and have a lot of charming presence. Locations are nice, the DoP did a great job with the lighting, and Eiza González has a great singing performance (refreshingly with no audible pitch correction, but as a professional singer with an amazing voice she really doesn't need any), even though the arrangement and interpretation of the famous \"Mack The Knife\" is quite horrible.But if anything, this has made me wish for a more silly WW2 comedy with Cary Elwes in the lead.

Its great cast distracts from the weak characterization in the script. Standouts are Henry Cavill (of course), Eiza Gonzales and Alan Ritchson. It's a very plot driven movie, but the plot is interesting (especially considering it is loosely based on real events). If the script made us care more about the people, this would have been great movie. Instead everyone comes off as \"movie characters;\" I'm sure the actual people involved were far more interesting than that. In some ways, the movie highlights a fascinating mission from WWII while doing a disservice to the men involved.Those script issues aside, the movie's direction and tone are very fun. There's a great musical sequence I very much enjoyed and I did find myself invested in the mission as the third act neared. Don't expect to be on the edge of your seat as this is less about suspense and all about style. But it was a fun time at the theater and I think it's worth seeing for that alone.Side note: YMMV but save for a bloody moment or two, it's far less graphic than the R rating may lead you to believe.\n\n                    26 out of 48 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "I found it to be a moderately entertaining actioner, I don't know why but I just couldn't get that into it. The dialog just seems to be stilted, fakey, and in at least one case wholly wrong - the story starts in 1942 and the character playing Churchill complains about America's reluctance to join the war effort. Humm, did they forget Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 - I thought that date that will live in infamy! Maybe the main cast is too good looking to be believable, surely not all of the \"Ungentlemanly Warfare\" men were this handsome - maybe throw in an ordinary looking guy for variety. And they cast Eiza González as a Brit - really? So, I cannot give an enthusiastic thumbs up to this one, I can give a half-hearted one. So, please check it out, and make up your own mind. 6/10.\n\n                    21 out of 45 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "Trust Guy Ritchie to bring us a completely unique presentation of a serious matter. 'The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare' is based on fact and tells the story of Operation Postmaster - a secret mission - which was carried out in 1942. Many people lost their lives during this operation (which off course is exaggerated in the movie) and yet the film has a lighthearted narration which sees the soldiers cracking jokes whilst killing the enemy. This is indeed a very different approach but it allowed for a highly entertaining movie which is not to be taken too seriously, and that was funny and enjoyable instead of nail-biting suspense.I absolutely loved Henry Cavill here, in the role of Gus March-Phillips, who leads the operation. In fact, the entire cast was just brilliant and I also thoroughly enjoyed hunky Alan Ritchson as Anders Lassen. This character was so inventive when it came to killing people, he was an absolute delight to watch!So, Gus March-Phillips is recruited to lead Operation Postmaster - a mission to cut off supplies to the German submarines in Nazi-controlled waters. Gus selects his own team, which consists of Henry, Freddy, and Anders. On their way, they rescue Geoffrey from captivity, and include him in their team.Then there are agents Marjorie and Heron, who is sent to the island of Fernando Po, so Marjorie can get close to Nazi Commander Heinrich Luhr in order to get information from him.The film follows the team as they execute their daring and ambitious plans. With every obstacle, they have to devise a new and more daring plan, and it was a lot of fun to watch! There was a bit too much killing for my liking, but the action sequences are fantastic and in general the film is thoroughly entertaining. The cinematography is good, and the Oscar-worthy score is AWESOME!! This was one of the best film scores I've heard in a while.From an entertainment perspective, 'The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare' delivered!! The film's climax is action all the way! I loved it.\n\n                    11 out of 24 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "\"How Churchill's Secret Warriors Set Europe Ablaze and Gave Birth to Modern Black Ops.\" Damien Lewis (from subtitle of his book)Having matured as a filmgoer in the 60's, I loved the derring-do, guns-for-hire adventures like Dirty Dozen and Professionals. Now Guy Ritchie has renewed the genre with The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare, a semi-fictional story wherein a group of mavericks is hired by British WWII leaders, including Churchill (Rory Kinnear), to neutralize the Nazi machine that produces U boats menacing Brits in the North Atlantic.Among the Brit officers is a young Ian Fleming (Freddie Fox), pre-James Bond-in fact, the lead maverick, Gus March-Phillips (Henry Cavill), may have been Fleming's model for Bond. The enterprise cannot be acknowledged by the Brits if the team is caught, and the Nazis would execute them. This based-on-a-true story is heroic by any definition.Ministry is an A movie for \"adventure\" and a B for badinage, making it a solid fit for summer escapism and a whiff of history. The subdued quips are Ritchie's renovation-fewer wise-guy asides and more unsubtle action. Henry Cavill nicely underplays the usually out-there leader such as Lee Marvin did. Much more bonhomie with Cavill.Ritchie also updates the genre by referring to Casablanca more than once. Good company. What he doesn't do is ratchet up the suspense, as in say Guns of Navarone. In fact, each encounter with the Nazis is too easy for the gang to navigate. Ritchie is relaxed with the conflict.Gus's cohorts are a mix of Dwayne Johnson and Steve McQueen types with a little Strother Martin on the side. Adding a sharpshooting femme fatale, Marjorie Stewart (Eiza Gonzalez), is a much-appreciated upgrade. She lends a sophisticated and deathly beauty, a danger for which the Nazis didn't quite account.Ritchie owes Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds in its setup and tone, although his execution is uneven: sometimes irreverent, sometimes grim. But, hey, it's almost summer and we're relaxing with a movie that does not claim to be historically accurate or artistically high. It's plain fun.\n\n                    11 out of 25 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

They managed to insert comedy at the right moments in what is arguably very serious content or situations. The acting was great, the characters were cast very well. The soundtrack was also very well done. While I did not find it distracting, I noticed the music which is something I am not normally super conscious about while watching a flick and must say it matched the scenes and time period fantastically. Totally loved the Swedish hunter character, never have I seen such light hearted, extreme brutality. The smug interactions between the characters was also amazing. I really liked how they took the stereotypical British, James Bond type, attitude and applied it to the dialog. Definitely recommend seeing this one. It also is worth mentioning, the Marjorie character took my breath away in a few scenes. Like I mentioned, the characters were awesome, the story was interesting and the movie was very well put together; had a great comedy, cheeky serious vibe. Hard mix of attributes to merge and successfully pull off, but these guys did it!

Adapting these big Japanese characters is a very difficult task, and almost all fall, but thankfully, they decided to do this animated, and spend time on story and character. The animation, by ILM (Industrial Light and Magic) is best there is this year.Three good animated films, this week, they are 'Inside Out 2, Deep Sea' and this. What a week for cinema! The directors Shannon Tindle and John Aoshima have done a clever looking film, some very good cinema photography and clean direction, makes things very pleasant. Shannon Tindle and Marc Haimes write a family story with three points of view, and you can debate on who is the real evil is, in this, so you can agree on motives or not.To be clear, you don't have to know anything about 'Ultraman' to enjoy this, the design is sharp and colourful, dialogue is not wishy washy, and a great cast is held together by a soundtrack that punches along. A great watch in the cinema.\n\n                    15 out of 19 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Did I want this in a Kaiju movie? Maybe not, but at the same time it was what gave the characters depth and the story emotional power.Also, this is a kiddie film, designed to appeal to small children and their parents who, probably, try to juggle a lot of things too, so technically it was good product.\n\n                    4 out of 5 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

The only honest sounding review here comes from the one that claims they watched it in two sittings. It's an ok movie that will probably take two sittings due to its underwhelming story. Either that or viewers will skip through it to get to its fantastic animation, no judgement on my part, I was very tempted to do the exact same thing.\n\n                    11 out of 47 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

I really hope this is the gateway for lots of new fans, I think it very well could be, and even if it isn't, it for sure told a great Ultraman story that newcomers and old fans can enjoy, on that note, go watch Ultraman Mebius I think the vibes are very similar.-Shuwatch.\n\n                    22 out of 28 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

The them fo family started off slow, but once I got to a certain point in the story, this story hit me hard with a lot of emotion. I also really enjoyed the journey of the main character of Ultraman in this movie. When you first meet Ultraman, he starts off as a selfish punk but as soon as he meets a certain character, he starts to grow and change into a much better person and hero. I also really liked the villain and he's one of those villains who really isn't a villain, he just a normal guy who's lost a lot in his life and he just wants to protect the people from the Kaiju even if that means he has do some horrible things. You can sympathize with him and his motivations, but he also needs to be stopped at the same time. And finally, the action in this movie is absolutely phenomenal from start to finish.Overall, Ultraman: Rising (2024) is easily one of the best movies that I've watched this and it's definitely one that I'll remember for years to come.\n\n                    5 out of 6 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Even the antagonist's motivations are explored, adding depth to the narrative.For those who grew up with Ultraman in the 80s, this movie is a nostalgic treat.

                "Content": "A really enjoyable and at times moving actioner, with a good heart and enough social commentary to elevate it above the ordinary.First time director (and kudos to him, this is a brilliant debut film) and star Dev Patel shows here that he is a director to watch and a bonified movies star. The boy has chops. Here he plays Monkey Man, an underground street fighter just striving to make a living in the slums of India but with a burning desire for vengeance. As the film progresses we are slowly introduced to both the target(s) of his vengeance and the reasons he is crippled by it.You've seen this all before in a hundred films of its type but this has enough style and substance to it to stand out from the rest. The fights scenes (especially as the film progresses and our protagonist improves) are dynamic and kinetic, the camera never stops moving. But there are enough quiet, still, thoughtful moments here to raise this film above the usual chaff. The flashback scenes are filled with warmth and beauty and show a real eye as a director. The film uses music exceptionally well to add both gravitas and levity to scenes where needed.With influences from western cinema, Indian cinema and especially 90s East Asian action flicks this film has enough pace and action for the fight movie fans but also enough of a story and heart for the general movie goer. You'll be rooting for our eponymous Monkey Man to get his vengeance. As I said a really excellent directorial debut from an already established young, proper movie star. The future really looks bright for Mr Patel.\n\n                    127 out of 199 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "Huge Dev Patel fan. Monkey Man is the first movie I've gone to see in the theaters in a very long time. I just don't get interested enough to not wait for it to be streaming.Monkey Man compelled me to go. It's probably the best movie trailer I've ever seen, or at least one of the best.The problem with the trailer that I foresee is many are going to walk out of the theater feeling misled.If you're an action movie fan, DO NOT GO SEE THIS IN THEATERS. Wait for streaming. This is a drama with elements of action and crime thriller. Anyone going in who thinks this is like John Wick will be sorely disappointed. The problem is, that's the impression the trailer gives.I'm actually not even a John Wick fan. I like action movies, but I don't seek them out often. What I thought could make Monkey Man special was the added substance of Indian mythology, culture, and a more fleshed out character drama that was hinted at in the trailer.Some of that was present, but it didn't come together nearly as well as I had hoped. I don't agree with the severe criticism of the action scenes and how they were filmed. I thought they were good and the shaky cam didn't bother me. Could it have been better? Probably. But I think the criticism there is overblown.Where the film missed its mark for me was the story itself. The first act was good, but in the second act it ground to a halt for 40 minutes or so of more of what we already learned in act 1, at the expense of pacing. Some parts were fleshed out way too much while other parts weren't fleshed out enough, making it feel off almost the whole movie. The supporting characters didn't get enough of this, which didn't help us care about them and also care about them joining the fight with our protagonist.I'm genuinely surprised at some of Dev's choices in Act 2. I actually admire him for trying to make a movie with more substance that could be called action to some degree, but I just think he didn't nail the blend of these things with Monkey Man. You could argue that he tried to do too much. There was a significant amount of extended flashback used throughout even up to the very end. This ended up taking us out of the present and hurting the flow of the story.I think Monkey Man as Dev Patel envisioned it might have been much better as a limited series. So that he could take his time and flesh everything out the way he wanted. Because again, there were some great elements in this movie. Good acting, good cinematography, good music (although it sounds as if it was more stereotypical Indian music and other cultural elements used), some great fight scene moments, and some fun bits. It just doesn't add up to a great movie.Someone else mentioned they felt detached a bit, and I agree. Despite the protagonist's story having the right emotional elements to draw us in, it didn't do it as much I had hoped for me.What I envision is a lot of people going into this expecting a pure action thrill ride, and they're going to be bored. Again, this is a drama, and one that I wanted to like more than I did.This doesn't sour me on Dev at all. He may have just bit off more than he could chew with this one, but he had the balls to go for it, and I respect that.\n\n                    102 out of 159 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "If you had told me a year ago that Dev Patel would play India's answer to John Wick, I would have thought you were crazy, but here we are with Monkey Man, in which the actor directs himself as a man determined to take revenge on the people who murdered his mother and stole their land.The film features plenty of brutal fight action - a mix of gun play and hand to hand combat - but Patel succumbs to that irritating trend - shaky cam with rapid editing; I'm sure this technique hides a multitude of sins, but it always feels a bit like a cop out to me and makes it rather difficult to follow the action. Monkey Man also suffers from erratic pacing, with lulls in the action that go on for a tad too long. If Patel had had the confidence to shoot his fight scenes in a less chaotic manner and had kept the pace more consistent, I think the film would have been better for it.That said, I didn't dislike the movie as a whole - Patel does well in his role as avenging angel and the level of violence is impressive. I definitely had far more fun with Monkey Man than either of the other two big screen releases I have seen recently: Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire and Godzilla x Kong, both of which were hugely disappointing.\n\n                    100 out of 173 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

The second hour of the movie could have been 20 minutes. There was no longer any plot, you knew exactly what was going to happen from the midpoint, you just didn't realize it was going to take over an hour of pensive looks and Dev punching 200 people. The best way I can describe it is if that scene from John Wick where he takes forever to get up the stairs and then he's right at the top and tumbles down? Imagine if that was half the movie. It could have been great if only it was properly edited.\n\n                    119 out of 219 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "Revenge movies being incredible or forgettable boils down to two factors. The quality of the action choreography and original fight scenes, and the ratio of backstory/reason for revenge to actually getting revenge. What made John Wick the pinnacle of revenge movies is how they masterfully build a world during action sequences, spending only the first 1% of the movie establishing his reason for revenge and then taking you for a thrill ride of artfully choreographed violence. Monkey Man sadly is not the Indian John Wick because where John wick does more with very little, Monkey Man conversely takes the opposite approach essentially dividing the film into two acts. The first half of the movie, roughly accounting for 65% of the duration of the 2 hour film consists of backstory, reason for revenge, and without spoiling anything, setbacks.A successful revenge movie understands that pacing is the sharpest blade. There may be setbacks. But they don't set back the pace as the movie always inches forward towards revenge.While it is true that it is possible to enhance the satisfaction of revenge by focusing more on the reason for that revenge, this is extremely difficult to do and in almost all cases ends up causing the movie to drag. This was very much the case with Monkey Man, or as my title refers to it - Monkey Marathon.Monkey Man has elements of what it needs to be to achieve a John Wick level of action film, but it goes in the completely wrong direction. Long form story telling. Drags. The whole first act drags and doesn't need to.78%\n\n                    55 out of 97 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Enhanced by some creative photography, the violence is brutal and visceral. Taking its time, the film asks the audience to be patient for the hero to fully come into his \"powers,\" but the payoff is well worth it. There is some \"shaky cam,\" but not too much to ruin the experience. The spirituality, as well as the legends told in the movie, really add to the overall story, giving the film more substance than a lot of action films. The villains could of been developed a bit more, especially the Lion, but that's nitpicking.\n\n                    107 out of 165 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "Monkey Man promised so much through the electrifying trailer, but unfortunately I was left thoroughly underwhelmed.For me this is primarily for one reason. The action was so poorly shot which is such an unforgivable sin for me. It was full of jarring cuts, shaky camera work, and disorientating pans and whips. Dev Patel clearly wanted a very kinetic and vibrant approach but it just wasn't executed well for me. This is such a shame as when the camera work did settle down the action was violent and gritty and could have been something really special. The stunt work all looked good, it just wasn't presented well at all.In terms of the story there isn't much to complain about. I've seen so many films of this ilk and Monkey Man doesn't necessarily stand out too much. Some side plots and characters added a little variety, but ultimately the story was fairly generic. Nothing great but nothing awful.Then there was the lead performance from Dev Patel which again I was left a tad underwhelmed by. He's a brilliant actor and considering he was directing I thought he'd really shine in this project, but he just failed to really draw me in as something was missing from his performance. None of the other characters were developed enough to particularly comment on their performances.One of the strengths of the film though is probably the look of the whole thing. There are some good creative choices in the sets, lighting etc, that do create a vibrancy and energy which worked well.With so many great films in this genre like John Wick, Taken, Nobody etc, there needed to be something in this film to really stand out. Unfortunately nothing did, resulting in a resoundingly mediocre affair.\n\n                    127 out of 242 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Nothing amazing/original here and it had some holes.-Acting was perfunctory, nothing stand out great and nothing atrocious.-Violence, on occasion there was some well shot satisfying violence.Now the bad bits:-All of the unrelenting shaky cam, absolutely no need for all of it. I almost walked out in the second act because of it and I've never walked out of a cinema. They tried to do longer type shots for the action especially in the final act with less shaky cam, but still not shot well.-Really, really too many out of focus shots, either the cameraman was really inexperienced or they had too much really bad stylistic advice. Really distracting and really frustrating (just like my overuse of \"really\")-Almost constant poor framing of shots. Nothing was easy to watch and fortunately once shot every few minutes was OK to give my eyes a rest. Not sure if they bothered checking the cinematographer's CV before they hired him. Surely they had one, right?-The action, I love action films especially gritty, realistic, violent ones where the choreography has to be sharp and flow. This wasn't bad by any means but completely forgettable and shot appallingly compared to any of the films mentioned above. Dev Patel was OK, but a couple of times he was waiting for a punch and just out of the rhythm of it.All in all a disappointing film and a waste of the price of the cinema.\n\n                    51 out of 94 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

This movie should have been an hour and half tops and would have felt much better. There are some great shots and some great choreography when you can see what's going on.

He has managed to create a worthwhile action film with some great set pieces, neck, breaking stunts and an overall good looking film.I think what triumphs the most is the fast pace, headache inducing editing (this is a positive) with some great colour schemes and set pieces. It's fast paced editing matched the chaotic streets of India, mixed with its rich culture and history.The soundtrack was reminiscent of John Wick, with it's party scenes and colour palette. There was some great cinematography, especially through its use of silhouettes towards the final act.You can see the directors, aim to portray the monkey man, as a legendary figure who supports the powerless, and the impoverished of India's lower class. He makes a stand against those who are in control, which is a great pairing for an action/revenge film.I will say that the second act does falter a bit in its speed and does drag down in some places however, it quickly picks up pace again in the last act where monkey man turns into a proper beast.You can see the message the director portrayed as he highlights the inequality surrounding the poor in India and uses this medium to show that there is hope and people willing to make a stand against those who are in control.All in all a decent action film with great choreography, stunts, soundtrack and editing. This is an enjoyable watch, but doesn't elevate much further than your standard action flick.All praise for Indian John Wick!\n\n                    57 out of 119 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Patel plays Kid, a.k.a. Monkey Man as many call him, with absolute persision. He embodies the character with such emotion, not many others could possibly think of playing him. While you won't hear much dialogue from Kid, he really expresses himself in his actions and you learn a lot about him as a person through these. In this situation, his actions speak louder then his words. While he does seem to a very original character, he does feel a bit too much inspired by John Wick which may lower the value of the film for some.Monkey Man, when it comes to violence and gore, dosen't hold back and goes completely unhinged, using nearly anything it can find as a weapon. While at some points it does feel somewhat excessive and unnecessary, especially in the final act, it is very well performed and cherographed but the visuals may be a bit much, even for the non-squimish. And at points it does feel its overshadowing a great story. Monkey Man could hit a lot more harder if they delved further into the story and lore, as well as the political situation that takes a main part through the story.Overall, Monkey Man is certainly not for those at all squimish but Patel's very strong performance and direction makes this one I would definitely recommend seeing this in a theatre and you might end up wanting to give it a rewatch.\n\n                    55 out of 123 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

There is nothing that we haven't seen before when it comes to our main lead's redemption arc, with the third act that just stops the film from moving forward. The brutality is there when it presses buttons, but the choreography gets lost quite often in chaotic camera shakes, making it impossible to feel the whole scale of the fight. For the hardcore action junkies, this can be either satisfying or not so much, but Dev Patel does his all to make this worthwhile. If only it wasn't muddled up particularly in the last 25 minutes or so.\n\n                    18 out of 36 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

He stars in it and is in acting form, and it's all really good in the giant size super screen I watched it in.I see that Dev has done his homework, the whole feel is of early Clint Eastwood crime films - 'Thunderbolt and Lightfoot', 'Joe Kid' plenty of Bruce Lee film references -'Enter the dragon' and others,the night time is captured also reminds me of Scorsese -'Mean Streets' quite a bit.The story of revenge is handed differently with the dream sequences and the use of Indian gods, spiritualism its very prevalent and plays a large role in the plot and the movement of the movie, which changes the whole dynamic and speed, it takes it time to get where it needs too. Kind of like Paul Andrew Williams film-'Bull' which is very similar to this in certain ways, that also is a another film that pulls off another Clint Eastwood film, that is' High Plains Drifter'.You get plenty of blood and violence in this, with a superb acting and roles, but, and there is a but, Dev's direction is slightly off the mark with the close up shots being too close and framing of shots in this, that is why it misses the 8/10 mark. I feel if this was shot on very large lines or IMAX, this would get the high rating I think is should.\n\n                    28 out of 61 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "Rating: 8.6\nOverall, Dev Patel uses an allegory to Hanuman to create a gritty and raw tour de force that is a political love letter to Indian Cinema and Martial Arts movies.Good to Very Good Direction (The direction on a macroscale is very raw and gritty to show this underbelly of India, yet the stunt choreography is very sharp and polished as it feels like all the action sequences are part of a well-oiled machine; the direction on a microscale is great as the interpersonal scenes give you a sense of how the conflict affects the protagonist; the direction of actors is very good as all the performances feel elevated and true to Indian culture; the storytelling is very good as it uses Hanuman and Hinduism to serve as an allegory to lay the blueprint on, and the film uses the personal connection the protagonist has to his mother drive this story forward; the tension is built very well as the protagonist's emotional rage helps fuel the intensity of the fight scenes), Good to Very Good Acting (Great from Dev Patel (A true leading man as he displays a wide range of emotions to convey all the feelings he has towards his mother and his past trauma, and he seamlessly transitions between these emotions; his action/stunts are very well executed and show how meticulous and technical he is in his craft), Pretty Good from Sharlto Copley (Helps provide comedic relief and give a 'non-Indian' voice for the film), Pretty Good from Pitobash (Feels like a comedic Bollywood/Tollywood side-kick character and develops good chemistry with Dev Patel), Pretty Good from Sobhita Dhulipala (Develops good chemistry with Dev Patel and plays his character's role well in providing insight in working with the corrupted, elite world), Pretty Good from Sikandar Kher (Plays the stereotypical Indian villain well), Pretty Good to Good from Vipin Sharma (Develops good chemistry with Dev Patel and plays the oracle figure well as he helps show the protagonist his true potential), Pretty Good from Ashwini Kalsekar (Feels like an authentic performance for an Indian of Elite status), Pretty Good from Makarand Deshpande (Plays his role well and does a good job at creating tension when working with the rest of the cast), Pretty Good from the rest of the cast (Everyone plays their role well because the whole cast feels like authentic Indian/Bollywood performances)), Very Good to Great Story (The concept is great as the overarching story is an allegory to Hanuman and Hinduism, but in the end, the story really boils down to Mother-Son relationship; the plot structure is laid out very well as each element felt like the right length and all the scenes built on each other to lead the movie to the climax; the character writing is great as the protagonist is an allegory for Hanuman and he is written holistically to show how his past trauma fuels his revenge, and the character writing for the rest of the cast is good as they fill in roles that are very stereotypical to films in Indian Cinema), Very Good to Great Screenplay (The dialogue is very authentic to Indian Cinema and is very engaging; the symbolism is incredibly profound as the movie on a macro-scale is an allegory for Hanuman, but on a microscale, the movie is really about a Mother-Son relationship and getting through trauma; the movie is surprisingly political as a good amount of the themes they bring up are anti-Indian Nationalist; the foreshadowing is great as it helps provide intrigue into the protagonist's past and his destiny, and these questions are answers very well as the movie transitions to its second act), Decent Score (Uses its themes well to help establish the mood, but was not used uniformly well); Decent Soundtrack(Some of the songs were used very well, but there were some songs that did not feel like they fit the tone), Pretty Bad Cinematography (The cinematography isn't necessarily bad, it is just very raw; there were many shots that I enjoyed and I felt like they used lighting very well to help establish the mood and emotions of the scene (giving a 'Blade Runner' esque feel at points), but it just felt like a lot of the shots felt very raw and took away from what was going on on-screen as it made it feel way more chaotic than intended), Bad Editing (Like the cinematography, the editing was not necessarily bad, it was just very raw, but unlike the cinematography, there are no redeeming factors about the editing because it made the movie way more choppy than it needed to be), Good Sound (Felt somewhat of an homage to both Indian Cinema and Martial Arts movies), Good Visual Effects (Good use of practical effects, helped make the fight scenes feel more detailed and gory), Great Production Design (Really brought to life India as it showed its urban sprawl, its beautiful jungles, and detailed temples), Good Makeup (Helped show the grit and grime of India, and the blood helped make the action sequences feel more realistic), Makeup (Helped show the grit and grime of India, and the blood helped make the action sequences feel more realistic), Good Costumes (Helped make the movie more authentically Indian), Costumes (Helped make the movie more authentically Indian), Pacing is very good as the movie feels like it is the right pace; the runtime is the right length as there was nothing that could have been cut or added, Climax is executed very well as the stunt choreography goes above and beyond and the action sequences feel so grand, yet raw, Tone is a mix of Indian Cinema, Martial Arts films, and high-octane action movies (while still leaving room for its dramatic moments), The stunt choreography for this movie needs to be studied as it feels so raw yet polished at the same time (and it is executed on such a high scale that it truly is a benchmark for action movies); This movie does an amazing job at representing multiple facets of India and bringing Indian representation to Hollywood.\n\n                    31 out of 81 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

I think everything about this movie is perfect: the visuals, the action, the dialogue, the costumes, the acting... it was both beautiful and apocalyptic. I loved how everything felt like a rock 'n' roll fest.I love dystopian movies, but you don't have to be a fan to recognize how amazing this was. It's a story of survival in a savage wasteland, every scene felt epic. I liked the cult-like nature and how they glorified their deaths like they were Vikings. Everything was eccentric and crazy, with non-stop action for nearly the whole movie.It's really dystopian and wild, so it's surprising that this was actually a mainstream hit. \"Do not become addicted to water\" was such a wild statement, lol.The premise is very simple; I don't think I can think of a more simplistic movie that worked so well. They drive out into the desert, then make a U-turn back to where they came from. That's it. And it's a blast. This is my favorite action movie, jam-packed with crazy sequences.The movie is really just one huge dystopian action sequence, so I guess the drawback could be that it's all action. If you're looking for something more, you won't find much. Apparently, Mad Max lore has some complex and darker elements, and maybe the upcoming Furiosa will delve deeper into that.Furiosa was probably the main character; it felt like Mad Max himself was just tagging along. The villain, Immortan Joe, was great. All the characters are memorable. And because the premise is so simple and the movie is so action-packed, it feels shorter than it actually is. It's just great fun and keeps me glued to the screen. Looking forward to Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga.\n\n                    21 out of 23 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

This movie also feels so fresh and in my mind, it is even way better than the original movies. The cast assembly of this main characters is also fantastic, Tom Hardy did amazing as the main man himself (Max), Charlize Theron did amazing as (Furiosa) and Nicholas Hoult was awesome as this character (Nux).Sure the movie isn´t exactly that realistic, but for what its worth, then i think it is actually awesome that they really didn´t try to go for the normal approach, but that they went there own way and created this masterful over the top reboot/remake of the also phenomenal original Mad Max movies.To every person who loves crazy over the top and not too serious action blockbusters, then this movie is definitely for you!!!!(9/10)\n\n                    9 out of 10 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

The reason I even saw it was the insane reaction the public had to this one...and the critical reviews were all surprisingly good. I wanted to see what all the hubbub was about...and try to understand why folks liked it so much. My take on it is that if you enjoy a film that is non-stop amazing action, then this one is for you. As far as the story goes, it's plot is super-thin--but the movie is handled so well and the stunts so amazingly insane that you don't mind. Worth seeing--but I sure wouldn't like to see a lot of films like this. Additionally, it was VERY refreshing to see a film where so many women are NOT mindless objects to be killed or protected--several are about as strong and heroic as Max himself--and no doubt this is why women seemed to like the film so much.\n\n                    97 out of 149 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is the finest piece of pure action spectacle that I've watched since THE RAID 2 and JOHN WICK. It feels like the MAD MAX film that George Miller always wanted to make, and in many ways it's a virtual remake of MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR, except with a grossly inflated budget and CGI effects used to enhance rather than dominate. Now, I love THE ROAD WARRIOR and always will, but MAD MAX: FURY ROAD truly is an action film for our times.I know that some will hate it; the story here is action and action alone and there's little else to get in the way. It's one long chase film and the amazing thing is how they manage to sustain the momentum for a good two hours. Exemplary cinematography and quite wonderful direction is what makes this work. With bad direction it would have been a real chore to sit through, but instead we get tons of suspense, great fight scenes, and incredible spectacle. This is the kind of film you watch to see stuff that's never been done before.Tom Hardy feels like an obvious fit for the role and brings some working class style charisma to the part. As many have commented, Max is often a supporting player in his own film, but Charlize Theron as the real lead is excellent too, so that's not important. Even Nicholas Hoult in support is fantastic. I loved the way that the bad guy is played by Hugh Keays-Byrne, who was the villain in the first MAD MAX all those years ago. Overall, though, this is a film not about the people, but the Namibian desert landscapes, the modded vehicles, the speed, the violence, the overall thrill of the chase. And it's pretty much my idea of a perfect film.\n\n                    149 out of 199 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "George Miller returns to live-action filmmaking with one of the greatest action films ever put to screen. 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is ridiculous in all the right ways.For those who have seen the original films and loved them, you'll fall in love all over again with this film. Tom Hardy takes the reigns this time around as Max - a man of few words who has been hardened by the world in which he lives. Along with him is Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa - a woman who seeks redemption by helping five young '\"wives\" escape from the film's antagonist.Leading up to the film's release, many speculated if this would be just another action film that lacks a solid narrative and motive, but I am happy to say that this is simply not the case. Yes, the film does fill 80% of its run-time with action sequences, but it never gets in the way of the humanity between these characters that Miller has brought to life. There are some emotional moments. Specifically, with Theron's character. Is the story something we haven't seen before? Not at all. But in a film loaded with action, it's nice to see a solid narrative.Now, how about those action sequences? Incredible - exhilarating - jaw-dropping. George Miller has put together some of the greatest, most memorable action set-pieces ever. One thing that sets the action in this film apart from a good majority of mediocre action films today is that every action the character's make have an affect on them. For good and for bad. The action is not pointless. It's motivated. And it's glorious to behold thanks to the use of practical effects, incredible stunt work and stunning cinematography.'Mad Max: Fury Road' has set a new standard for action films. It's arguably the greatest action film of the 21st century. It's that good. George Miller has brought back what we loved about 80's action films while also brining new ideas to the table. It's the best time I've had in a theater in a long time, and I couldn't help but laugh in appreciation of the ridiculousness that was unfolding before my eyes. The film left me feeling giddy, with a big smile on my face.\n\n                    385 out of 568 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "Mad Max: Fury Road, starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, is George Miller's attempt to reignite his long dormant Mad Max franchise...and my god does he ever. For the past decade or so, with exceptions such as John Wick, The Bourne Trilogy, and The Raid, action movies seem to be struggling to capture the excitement and enjoyment the genre once held; a tenacity that classics from the 80's and 90's had in spades. George Miller single handedly delivers our saving grace with Fury Road on the back of a spike covered oil rig with a blind zombie playing a fire breathing electric guitar.Max is a man of few words, but Tom Hardy's talent for portraying strong, silent characters shines through in a gruff but sympathetic performance. He teams up with Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa to save the last 5 hot women in the world from the leader of a powerful cult with a terrifying breathing mask inspired by the Cheshire Cat from Alice in Wonderland. From there, the chase is on. Using this simple plot as the setting, we are able to bear witness to one of the most beautifully shot films in years. The world of Mad Max looks absolutely gorgeous, combining awe-inspiring practical effects and landscapes with bold colours brimming from all edges of the frame. These are of course just bonuses in enhancing the primary reason people will love this film, the action itself. I'm happy to report these action sequences are damn near flawless. No shaky cam, barely a hint of CGI, and scenes where we actually feel like our characters are in danger (yes Furious 7 I'm calling you out). Total chaos relentlessly ensues for the majority of the film, but it's chaos you can follow clearly and marvel at. Whether it's one of the explosive car sequences, or one of the smaller emotional moments, Mad Max: Fury Road refuses to let up on tension for one second.There's a reason this movie is sitting at 98% on Rotten Tomatoes. This is an action movie that will set a precedent for years to come, roaring ferociously at all who may challenge it. Hopefully, this is only the beginning of a genre revolution early in the making.FINAL VERDICT: Mad Max: Fury Road is a beautifully chaotic display of masterfully executed action sequences with a strong emotional core, and a raw energy unmatched by nearly all of its action genre competition.\n\n                    365 out of 588 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Without this passion, the film would have likely stooped as there's not much else in the way of a plot or character development, even though Theron tries her hardest to give us an enthralling new action heroine to be revered. Aside from the aforementioned writing setbacks, 'Fury Road' is a powerhouse in the technical categories. With stunning contradictory cinematography from John Seale giving us a post-apocalyptic world of lavish colour rather than your typical muted tones, a heart-pounding score from Junkie XL and exquisite production design work that rightfully earnt the film an Oscar (one of six) for its spectacular vehicle design.\n\n                    365 out of 612 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Gibson dropped out this film and he wasn't interested, it was in development for years, since in 2004 this movie was announced. George Miller did something different with this film and he got hate for it. I hate Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome to death! It is rated PG-13 family film and I wanted an action bloody rated R film not a boring stupid lame fu**** movie! I got an rated R bloody action film that I wanted in Mad Max: Fury Road. I was entertained and I enjoy it. At least it wasn't so sick like was Beyond Thunderdome. Mad Max: Fury Road is my second favorite film in the franchise and this movie did it right and it correct that third film that it failed been an good action film. Like it or hate it, is your problem but in my opinion it is a good action violent movie and I love it to death I am an action junkie myself. Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is my number 1 favorite film of all time. I think Mad Max: Fury Road is George Miller's masterpiece. Finally, Finally after 30.years of fiasco Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome that completely destroyed the Mad Max Trilogy, George Miller finally come back and fix the mistake he did 30.years ago. Why wouldn't I love this film? This film is the best one in the series along side Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior at least for me it is the best film. It has action, high explosive and Tom Hardy been a real Mad Max unlike Mel Gibson was in Thunderdome. I am happy they made the 4th movie. Tom Hardy was a bad ass Mad Max. I didn't even noticed that we don't have Mel Gibson in here. Tom Hardy breaths life into Max Rockatansky and Charlize Theron is excellent and emotionally perfect as Furiosa. I love high speed and pursuit on a road which I seriously love this. The thing was more similar to Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior but much better, George Miller fix it, the film did not copy The Road Warrior the film has it is own story. All, the stunts and action sequences are SPECTACULAR. Immortan Joe was a fantastic villain in here he was really good. The film shows a real wasteland and the future which I am really happy about it. NOTE: \"Don't waste your time if you have seen the original.\" from a hater review my reply: Yes I will waste my time watching this awesome action flick! Yes I have seen the Original Film Mad Max with Mel Gibson so many times than you ever did! I love this film much more than Mad Max because sometimes the original is very boring and the film has so much Drama in it and less Action than it is in Fury Road. I wanted to have an apocalyptic action film like are Fury Road and The Road Warrior which this film fix it. Finally yes Finally I have seen a good Action Film from 2015 and It is finally the finest blockbuster of 2015! Mad Max: Fury Road is a 2015 post-apocalyptic action film directed and produced by George Miller, and written by Miller, Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris. The fourth installment in the Mad Max franchise, it is an Australian and American venture produced by Kennedy Miller Mitchell, RatPac-Dune Entertainment and Village Roadshow Pictures. The film is set in a future desert wasteland where gasoline and water are scarce commodities.10/10 Awesome film I have seen it twice. I love this film to death I love it! Fury Road would be the second favorite best film in the franchise.\n\n                    269 out of 456 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "I see a lot of negative reviews for this movie popping up. People complaining that there is a lack of story and character development, and too much action.... too much action? Really? Have these people never seen a Mad Max movie before? How is that a bad thing in a Mad Max movie? Fury Road feels like an 80's action movie, with a preposterously large budget, and it is GLORIOUS. This movie was an epic ride. So many awesome set pieces, incredible car designs, twisted and bizarre costumes and characters, and a lot of really strong warrior women as well.I've also heard it said that this movie contains a lot of feminism. Strong female characters that kick butt, is not feminism people! There's no anti-men message here. Just a cast which is dominated by more women than men. And about time for a change! Charlize Theron is my new favorite actress after this (it used to be Sigourney Weaver and Linda Hamilton). She really takes the spotlight, and that is about the only criticism I can think of with this movie. It's not so much about Mad Max, but about road warriors in general, and specifically Theron's character. I didn't think Tom Hardy was quite as good as Mad Max as Mel Gibson was, but he wasn't terrible. He just didn't lend enough presence to his character in this movie. Which may be a hard thing to do when the movie does not focus on Max.Special mention should also be given to all the side characters. The villains are enjoyably menacing, especially Hugh Keays-Byrne as Immortan Joe, John Howard as the People Eater, Richard Carter as the Bullet Farmer, and I also loved Melissa Jaffer as the leader of a gang of elderly motor ladies.Go see this movie if you like Mad Max!\n\n                    59 out of 92 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

A universe that's been left in ruins from war and only a few people left with different psychological damages is a good concept. But Mad Max: Fury Road honestly fails to succeed with making an impressive film from it.The many different cool and fantastically engineered cars, which the entire movie is based around are amazing. Alongside, a few beautifully filmed scenes Mad Max turn out to have a few beautiful scenes. But this is about all Mad Max: Fury Road has going for itself.The film is quite boring. It's based on the plot of driving a straight line for half the movie. Then realising they cant continue to then turn around, and drive back for the rest of the film. Meanwhile basically being on constant fight scenes along the way. Even so, most fight scenes are quite poorly filmed. The director used odd angles. Where a lot of the time you couldn't even make out whats going on.I don't really recommend you watch Mad Max: Fury Road. The Mad Max universe is a cool concept, but without it, this movie would be nothing.\n\n                    15 out of 19 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "Mad Max Fury Road is George Miller's return to the franchise he started way back in 1979 with Mad Max. I will start by saying this movie was absolutely batsh** insane. It was filled right to the brim with continuous over the top bloody ridiculous action sequences that keep you on the edge of the seat and just amazed at what Is happening on screen. Now this film doesn't have much of a plot at all but seriously you're not going into this film for an intense plot, this is a film that almost didn't even need one at all. The one thing I was worried about going in was whether I needed to have seen the previous films to understand this one and thankfully you don't, the story is independent of the previous film which was really helpful. The characters were all awesome and it did an amazing job to introduce them all almost instantly and get right into the action. Max (Tom Hardy? and Furiosa (Charlize Theron) were were great and extremely likable characters. Even the villain who I will just call Sweet Tooth was so great, he wasn't anything too special but was a great threat throughout the film. I just absolutely loved this movie, intense action from start to finish and didn't slow down at all, that made it ridiculously fun to watch. The great characters and the performances are awesome on screen and we're always interesting to watch. If there was ever a Twisted Metal movie, this is what it would be. Nothing really let the film down and everything really worked, such a great time and the best cinema experience this year so far. - 10\n\n                    931 out of 1,676 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "Fury Road is a near perfect movie. It may be the best Mad Max film from a story perspective, and almost definitely the best from a technical perspective.As far as the pre-production work goes, the smooth camera focus from shot to shot, the frantic way scenes are filmed, the risky and flawless stunt choreography, the vehicle designs, costumes, and settings are all executed and established brilliantly. For the post-production work, the filters for day and night are awe-inspiring, with the night being so uniquely illuminated and the day looking so otherworldly yet familiar with the colours standing out and blending simultaneously as well as how the explosions appearing as if they're bleeding into the screen. The CGI effects are used sparingly and effectively, looking as convincing as they need to be. The score supports the thrills and emotions present throughout in the terrifyingly insane world the characters inhabit. Speaking of, the performances are all top notch, no particular favourites as everyone seemed to be doing their part wonderfully, from the main players like Max and Furiosa to the side characters like Slit and Rictus, everyone. The story is essentially one big escape and pursuit, executed in an effectively efficient manner.Honestly aside from one or two easily overlooked plotholes there's nothing I can really say to discredit this movie. The only thing I could say is that Max doesn't really feel like the main character until closer to the end of the movie but that's kinda just it.Overall, I'm probably not thinking of everything I enjoyed about this film, but that's just because there is so much to love. Fury Road is perhaps the best action movie of the decade.\n\n                    7 out of 8 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

The action keeps you on the edge of your seats biting on your nails the whole time. Also the background score was very well composed and really immersed us in the movie.

From the very beginning to the last scene, I was completely immersed in this wild and intense world created by George Miller. I think this movie is a real masterpiece, and it's not hard to see why.The cinematography is breathtaking, the best I've seen in an action movie. Every scene is carefully shot and choreographed, resulting in a visual spectacle that's simply stunning. The deserts, cars, costumes, character looks, and color contrasts make this world unforgettable. It's one of those rare movies where every frame could be in an art gallery.The soundtrack is amazing, taking the action to a whole new level. Every beat drives the story and the intensity of the action scenes, pumping up the excitement to the max. It's a truly unforgettable auditory experience.And as for the story, I'd call it simple but spectacular. George Miller tells an exciting tale at a fast pace that never lets the audience rest. From the moment the action kicks off to the climax, there's not a dull moment. It's a rollercoaster that keeps us glued to the screen from start to finish.But it's in the action scenes where the movie really shines. They're all simply epic, the most mind-blowing I've ever seen in cinema. The fight choreography and the car chases are masterful and breathtaking. Every stunt and explosion is done in an unmatched way.In the end, \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" is more than just an action movie; it's an example of how to create a true cinematic masterpiece. It's one of those rare films that manages to be both visually stunning and narratively engaging. Alongside \"Terminator 2,\" it's without a doubt one of the best action movies I've ever seen and an experience that no one should miss.\n\n                    9 out of 11 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

A  blockbuster that is gritty and doesn't have a sense of humour that  could be equated to a fluffy kitten. No 'lets all hug' sentimental BS.  This is seriously a movie I thought I'd never see: a CGI-filled  blockbuster that I flat out loved. The stunts are so much fun, the FX  so great, it is the first movie I have seen where I have thoroughly  enjoyed all this type of stuff - probably because the cinematography  for once doesn't suffer cos of it. It is all incredibly shot.  The action is so brutal and appropriately high-octane. I thought to  myself more than once, 'I think I am loving this more than Terminator  2' but other than that, there wasn't time to think. It kicked off fast  and barely stopped, and the lulls were amplified by the insanity  preceding them. Plus it is a dark film, which made it even better. I  many people do an Aussie accent even close to well, was Hardy actually  trying for that? Either way, he didn't talk much so it didn't really  matter. This is more Theron's movie than Hardy's, he doesn't say much  and does next to nothing for the first third or so. Theron's Furiosa is  more of the hero is the story, if there were to be a hero in such a  grisly and dark world.  I don't even like this type of movie but the execution is  everything. I'm gonna go see this again, soon. 4.5/5\n\n                    568 out of 1,027 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

The film is a gripping full adrenaline race across the desert of a post-apocalyptic future. The action sequences are mesmerizing and the work of a true master craftsman in action. What is perhaps the most enthralling part of the film is the absolutely absurd story and world building. Miller created a fantasy world where men playing flame throwing guitars and leaping through high speed chases on pull-vaults seems like a typical milk run. The movie keeps a relentless action pace that makes all of the absurdity seem so completely ordinary, which might be the real magic of this movie. This is only really possible because the action, filmography, set choices and music are so brilliant you cannot help but believe the insanity that plays out before you. You want to believe the fiction because of the quality of the production. The movie also features some surprisingly good performances. Charlize Theron being the real the star of the film, with the titular character really only acting as her support.\n\n                    98 out of 173 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

First of all, the stunts and action sequences are SPECTACULAR. Tom Hardy breaths life into Max Rockatansky and Charlize Theron is excellent and emotionally perfect as Furiosa. The story opens, with Immortan Joe who has young ladies as his wives, but he'll goes down when they escape the sadist's hands. Max, who has a violent past with Joe's cronies, decides to help Imperior Furiosa take the girls somewhere safe. Furiosa can't trust Max, and neither can he. So it all comes down to Joe's cronies fighting against them reaching to their destination. The movie is a bananas car chase for the runtime, as Max and Furiosa work together to fight against the evils. And then, there is Nux, a bonkers \"really skin coloured\" guy, who works with Joe, played well by Nicholas Hoult. The 3D really pays off, and is worth the extra ticket. The movie puts all other action movies of shame, the effects really pop out. Well, this is a definite masterpiece. One of the best movies of the year, one of the best action movies ever made and the role of Theron's life. Miller is truly a mastermind as stated clearly in the trailer. This exceeded my expectations, and will exceed yours as well. The dark style, dark comedy and the over the top characters make a return in this reboot.

It took about fifteen minutes to figure out who was who. Apparently, the guy with the death mask and the tubes was seen as a god, that there was some religious following. Could be interesting, I guess. But what follows is one chase after another with every conceivable vehicle that some guy could dream up. There were porcupine cars. Monster trucks. Guys on poles dropping into vehicles. There was no logic presented as to why one vehicle would have a spear thing thrown at it and explode while others were hit with heavy artillery and seemed to move on just fine. Then we have Mad Max who is a captive with a mask that looks like a 1955 Oldsmobile grill. He is put on the front of a vehicle as all this combat goes on. Unfortunately, he has absolutely no personality whatsoever. There was never any suspense in this film because the place they were trying to get to was never really in our mind's eye. Then there's the short crop haired female which seems to be a standard these days. Make her look masculine and she becomes more formidable.

In the first 30 minutes, it cans to establish the universe by the dialogues, the absurd situations that Max finds himself in and the very well introduced characters. Then, when you accept what is being shown on the screen, the movie doesn't save on action scenes, that are chaotic, full of explosions, cars flying, bodies being thrown up and... A guy in red with a flame-spouting guitar. But this movie's triumph is that these action sequences are not tiring, quite the opposite. This is due to the development and construction of characters like Nux(Nicholas Hoult, who has one of the best emotional arcs of the movie) and Furiosa (Charlize Theron) who, whether you like it or not, is the protagonist of the movie, and it adds to the emotional and dramatic weight of the scenes.But the only problem in the movie is the reasonableness of some characters and their development like Imorttan Joe, who is imposing in the look but he doesn't talk and does a lot in the movie. It was to be expected more from Tom Hardy as Max, who has an important role in the story, but his development boils down to flashbacks and catchphrases.The movie color palette is strong, contrasting, with orange and red vibrant tones, but also making a transition of clear to dark tones in night scenes for example, something almost black and white. The cinematography is amazing. The sceneries are simple and minimalist, open plans, and the cinematography makes you tense, because it gives you an anticipation to persecution scenes, you can see the danger coming and it holds your attention to what decisions the characters will make and what will happen next.Overall, the movie is a really good.\n\n                    4 out of 4 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

It has all the intensity and perversity of the MAD MAX and THE ROAD WARRIOR, but amped up to new heights of craziness.

                "Content": "As a hard-core Kaiju fan of many years, I love that we are being treated to all of these Godzilla movies as of late. My opinion of the first two in this series (Godzilla and Godzilla: King of the Monsters) is that they were (somewhat) reality based and not obviously made for children. My criticism of G v K (the ending in particular) and this movie is that so much of it is far-fetched and fantasy based. Much more cartoonish.The bottom line is, they're making the monsters out to have too much human intelligence when they should actually be more animalistic. This was like watching a superhero movie and in my opinion, making the monsters out to be superheroes is a huge mistake. That's what happened when Toho did this in the 60's/70's which resulted in Godzilla movies becoming silly, low-budget kids movies, which has since been ridiculed for decades and has tarnished Godzilla's image. I understand the writers are trying to be creative and give the fans something different from all of the other monster movies out there, but this can be done without all the cheese. Please stop making the monsters so human!I enjoyed the movie but have to admit that I am somewhat disappointed.\n\n                    154 out of 173 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Luckily, I wasn't disappointed, I got everything what I expected which might be summoned by the two equations above.About humans:\nIf you want to watch the movie at home, don't waste time on humans subplot. It's completely pointless. The dialogues aren't funny or smart. They serve poor exposition which is painfully exhausting to watch. You see the monsters fighting and these \"characters\" are explaining in between: oh, he is protecting! - Come on, who wrote this? In my opinion if Legendary Studios wants to include humans, they should at least try making them just little interesting or just remove them completely. None of them is doing anything necessary, furthermore whatever they're doing doesn't make any sense. Why the hell are they in the Hollow Earth without protection? One guy is just in a Hawaiian shirt. The amount of dangerous monsters is not alarming, I guess... Paper Boy is filming everything but the British guy in a Hawaiian shirt says something like: It's better to keep it in a secret, this ancient civilization shouldn't be exposed to our world. The girl from Godzilla Vs. Kong (she is from that world and has weird X-Men power (?)) is among modern people, so the world already knows the underground world. What does he want to hide? There is more of this stupidity.About the monsters:\nKong is the lead. His journey is simple, he feels lonely, he wants to have a family of his kind. From the trailers you know, there is more giant apes, so I am happy to see them because I am Team Kong :) I'd want to appreciate the \"dialogues\" between Kong and this little ginger fella. They don't use words as we do but believe me, these two are more interesting than the humans. You will enjoy it.Godzilla and the rest are just monsters. Sadly Godzilla isn't intimidating in this movie, his only goal is to gain the pink level of nuclear power and then use it to fight the bad monkey. However, the fight scenes are awesome - this is why we are watching this type of movies, so if you're a fan of giant monsters, I recommend Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire... and don't expect to see raise of \"the new empire\" in this movie. It's a kinda awkward title generated by ChatGPT.\n\n                    247 out of 306 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

That's why we go to something like this, right?G X K is about the same for entertainment wise as G vs K, though I'd give the newest entry a slight edge for a couple of reasons. For one, there's a bit less silliness. There's comic relief of course, but it's not out of place or goofy. The 80's throwbacks with the tunes, synths, and vibes were great. And lastly, the Titans were back to being the bad guys instead of humans. I always find it a bore when you watch a movie about monsters fighting, but have to bare through a story of human villains and their idiotic ideologies.A side note, it's hilarious that these Titans seem to really enjoy having their royal rumbles in the biggest cities on the planet, or while destroying some of the world's most revered structures. Like really guys, you couldn't have thrown down in the middle of the Sahara? More destruction equals more entertainment I suppose. Also, Godzilla just casually murders hundreds if not thousands just walking around from point A to point B. I digress.

                "Content": "Releasing merely weeks after the critically and commercially acclaimed \"Godzilla Minus One\" won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects is a boon as well as bane for \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" - while more people are familiar with the behemoth radioactive lizard, there is an undeniable urge to draw comparisons between the two movies. Adam Wingard's second Monsterverse film following 2021's \"Godzilla vs Kong\" delivers satisfying Titan action, but overall, the film feels like a step back, largely owing to dull and tedious human drama.Personally, I found \"Godzilla vs Kong\" to be the best Monsterverse film. It embraced the absurdity and silliness of its premise and made the most of it to deliver one hell of a show, placing the Titans front and centre, while jettisoning any unnecessary human drama. \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" starts off much slower, with the actual plot taking nearly 20 minutes to kick in. Combined with an uptick in uninteresting human drama, this slows down the movie with certain portions feeling boring.Much like its predecessor, \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" struggles trying to the connect the stories of the two leading titans. Kong is the heart and soul of the movie, with Godzilla largely feeling like an accomplice or sidekick. The first half of the movie is almost entirely about Kong's exploration of Hollow Earth, the subterranean ecosystem where the Titans live. While learning about the mystical world was engaging and intriguing, it lead to a delayed introduction of the villain, leading to the third act feeling slightly rushed and less rewarding compared to the enthralling finale of \"Godzilla vs Kong\".The action sequences themselves are a whole lot of fun, with a face off in hollow earth with gravity slightly messed-up being one of my favourites of the entire franchise. The finale in Rio delivers plentiful excitement and fun too.\"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" is best suited for fans of the Showa era. For Kong fans(like myself), there is a lot to like about the movie, owing to the humanisation of the great ape. The action scenes are fun, colourful and campy, similar to it's predecessor, but an increased focus on human characters and a slower pace make this a slightly underwhelming entry to the Monsterverse.\n\n                    101 out of 138 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

The movie is filled with monkeys throughout, making it more like an independent Kong film because it barely depicts Godzilla, with Kong having far more screen time than Godzilla. I feel like Godzilla's role was forcefully added and feels disconnected from the rest of the movie. Also, the portrayal of SHIMO is superficial, failing to showcase its power, while Skar King is portrayed as a clown; it can't even defeat King Kong one-on-one, lacking a strong antagonist that leads to a rushed conclusion of the final battle. Finally, I have a big question: why do the director and writers like monkeys so much?\n\n                    67 out of 91 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Soon as we got to the ones with ms hall and skarsgard they went down the pan and in the gutter. All flashy bright colors felt like we were watching iron man.

Not just their actions but their presence and size.. a bit of slowness in how they walk and move, to feel that \"thud\" when they take a step and the sheer overwhelming presence that they represent - Like in Pacific Rim or in Godzilla King of the Monsters. You FEEL the bigness and the size.A splash in the ocean can causes huge tide-waves due to the size.A resounding BOOM that is felt when two Kaiju's collide.Where is that?There is no respect paid to the bigness.It's just they took some superhero action sequences and applied them to giants and made them move like they were the same size as humans.There is no FEEL or BIGNESS - It's simply a 6 out of 10 movie because it caters \"enough\" to enough people because it goes for what's popular and throws a lot of it while giving away the depth and the \"feel\" of a big monster movie that is what godzilla is meant to be.\n\n                    84 out of 133 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Especially Dan Stevens. But then I AM kinda biased towards him as I've loved his work in everything I've seen him in so far.All that aside, Kong was great - and MASSIVE - and Godzilla was pretty damn impressive, too - and just as massive as Kong - but more than that, we got a look at a few other Titans as well, and they were ALL pretty impressively brought to life here. My ONLY gripe about Kong himself is that, in the early going the filmmakers tried to humanise him just that little but too much, and it kinda fell flat to me.

The jokes land a bit better this time around. The aura & creative decisions in this film have almost an 80's vintage vibrant feel, the music & color palette compliment each other perfectly along with cinematography.My issues? Well... why does the movie have Monarch being okay with bringing anybody down to hollow earth? Reliance on slight jumpy exposition, small things that could have been explored a little more to leave more an impact. It's not perfect for those, however I will argue this film was a lot closer to striking close to being perfect than you would think a film of this caliber could do.This is what happens when Cinematography, awareness, consistency & finding the footing on following Kaijus, gets the best of a cinematic experience, it's just as much a kaiju story as it is a human story & It's a Love Letter to the showa era & fans should be proud.I've never been more invested in the actual story of the kaijus until this movie, expositions & humans don't ruin it either this time. It's not anything special, but what is special are what we are here for, & that's the Kaijus.New Empire, by far, has the longest showtime for Kaiju action that I've ever seen in a monster flick. Beautifully shot cinematic camera scenes, there is one specific upside down shot unfolding to the right side up, just amazing cameraworkThe gradual building blocks embedded in the story left exciting awe in entertainment & care of handling Kaiju moments. The humans are just enhancers for the monsters. Compared to GVK, they have a better direction here without getting lost.It's a ride, took the issues of GVK & corrected it more, there's plenty of action if not more than you'd think... there's plenty of surprises, emotional character moments with humans/monsters, & although a not so perfect expositions still a solid fun plot/story following the elements at play... Godzilla X Kong was a lot better than I thought it was going to be & that's worth something.7.5 / 10.\n\n                    120 out of 215 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "Wow, just wow. Now the thing is, the reason I am saying wow, is for a few big reasons that can probably relate to a lot of regular humans like me because I am most definitely human and not Godzilla trying to promote his own film. The reasons being; CGI, Big monster go rahh, and epic battle scenes. Anything else is boring and I frankly could care less about in this film because it affects nothing and all I care about are the things that THE FILM IS ACTUALLY ABOUT (humans).First, I wanna start off by saying that comparing this film's CGI to Godzilla Minus One (greatest Godzilla film that actually made me care about humans), budget wise, is like an insult. GMO had a budget near abouuuut 20 million or so, while GXK had 10x the budget. GMO managed to achieve winning an Oscar with 100x less visual art employees and having the best and probably the most realistic large scale CGI I've seen ever. BUT, the CGI even with such a smaller film beating it, is still excellent as always and doesn't look like some PS5 game that was reprogrammed to run on a Nintendo Switch, unlike other films. It has definitely been one of the consecutive aspects of the MonsterVerse.Monsters; I'm a sucker for Godzilla, not so much Kong, but this version of him definitely catches my eye. Godzilla and Shimo were what really brought this film together, and the funny thing is, before I saw Godzilla with pink atomic breath, it was my most disliked color, but on him, it's my preferred look for him. I also already loved cold related things so a big beast like Shimo definitely made me see this film.Battle Scenes. Now I know, I know, not all Godzilla films can entirely be epic fight scenes, I'M JUST SAYING, I wish they were longer. They are definitely what everyone, including me, came to see, and I am beyond glad with the outcome of the film, that I totally didn't see coming (that's sarcasm), and I actually would love to see more of the franchise, whatever it may be. Also to anyone who disliked the movement speed of Godzilla, watch literally any dated Godzilla film.In summary, I love Godzilla, Dune Part Two and GMO still beat it by an inconceivable number, but if you like big monsters or just Godzilla in General, watch this, maybe watch it again, or just watch the fight scene clips.\n\n                    96 out of 182 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

It's overpowered monster WWE seemingly presented as something the filmmakers *believe* or estimate an audience will like; as if it were the product of a soulless spreadsheet.These tired titans of bygone cinema have been pulled back into the limelight as the viewer suffers a nowhere-plot aimed at the lowest common denominator. The Kaiju terror is here, but in a very watered-down state.No dialogue because it's just senseless roaring beasts? Don't need to pay anyone to write a good script. Excessive closeups of the beasts all the time? Well that handily means they didn't need to animate higher-budget complex scenes from a more interesting POV. Sensory overload to distract the viewer from the complete lack of actual substance? Check.

Director Adam Wingard has adopted this approach when making this film, but on this occasion very little that is being randomly tossed about actually sticks. The smackdowns between the film's creatures are loud, frantic and reasonably fun, but the plot is a sloppy turd of Titan proportions -- a stinky, contrived, overblown mess brought to life in a maelstrom of not very convincing CGI.The script is absolutely terrible, and the majority of the film had me either scratching my head in confusion or laughing at its preposterousness. Kong being equipped with a metal fist is an undeniably cool idea, but the fact that the protagonists just happen to have such a device on hand in Hollow Earth is just crazy (especially one with built in anti-frostbite serum!). A vet who knows how to extract a Kong tooth also knows how to fly a Hollow Earth hover ship -- clearly a man of many talents. God only knows what the Iwi tribe were up to with their glowing pyramids. What was the deal with that glowing spike that nasty ape used to control the ice lizard? And why did everyone suddenly start floating around in Hollow Earth? (there might have been explanations for some of these points, but they became lost in all of the chaos).After Godzilla Minus One, I suggest leaving all future films featuring the big lizard to the Japanese.3.5/10, rounded down to 3 for Kaylee Hottle's perpetually anxious look -- doesn't the girl have any other expressions?\n\n                    215 out of 302 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

If you expect the same level of seriousness from both films, you'll likely be let down by this one. However, if you go into it expecting a silly, fun movie, that's exactly what you'll get.

In fairness it picked up towards the end though.A signal coming from somewhere within the Hollow Earth causes Godzilla to begin to strengthen himself for an upcoming battle. Within Hollow Earth, Kong unwitting reveals a deeper level, that was previously sealed off and within that level are other giant apes, ruled over by a tyrannical king Skar. Kong challenges Skar but is wounded in a losing effort. Desperate he heads to the surface to convince Godzilla to join him in the battle.That all sounds pretty exciting I know, but its all belaboured by a relatively boring middle section, that we spend with the human characters, exploring the Hollow Earth. The humans themselves are actually pretty good. Dan Stevens is great in everything and he's having a lot of fun here. He has good chemistry with lifelong friend Rebecca Hall and with Bryan Tyree Henry, both of whom are reprising their roles from \"Godzilla vs. Kong\". Still though their voyage through Hollow Earth is lacking in peril, or excitement. (Whilst we're here, the \"Monarch\" TV series established that time moves much slower in Hollow Earth than it does on the outside world - a fact that this film ignores entirely.)It does, as you might imagine, pick up for a zero gravity multi-Titan battle that takes place leading into the films climax. From that moment on I was engaged with the film and enjoyed it through to the ending.I don't know how helpful it is to compare this with \"Godzilla Minus One\" as despite sharing the same character, they have very different objectives in the stories they tell. But I did feel this was inferior to the last Monsterverse film and I'm not sure where I'd take the series from here.\n\n                    6 out of 11 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "As a long-time fan of monster movies, I eagerly anticipated the release of \"Kong and Godzilla: The New Empire,\" hoping for a thrilling showdown between these iconic titans. Unfortunately, the film falls short on nearly every front, delivering a lackluster experience that left me more frustrated than entertained.First and foremost, the plot is a convoluted mess. The story feels cobbled together from cliches and lacks any real coherence. The attempt to weave in human drama feels forced and unnecessary, detracting from the monsters that should be the stars of the show. Instead of focusing on the epic battles, we are subjected to tedious subplots involving forgettable human characters who add nothing of value to the narrative.Speaking of battles, the film's action sequences are surprisingly dull. One would expect a film featuring Kong and Godzilla to be packed with jaw-dropping, edge-of-your-seat moments, but what we get are poorly choreographed fights that lack any real sense of danger or excitement. The special effects, while decent, are not enough to save these uninspired confrontations.The performances from the human cast are mediocre at best. It's evident that even talented actors struggled with the poorly written dialogue and shallow character development. Their motivations are unclear, and their actions often defy logic, making it difficult to invest in their fates.Additionally, the pacing of the film is atrocious. At over two hours, it drags painfully, with long stretches where nothing of significance happens. The movie's climax, which should be the highlight, feels rushed and anticlimactic, leaving much to be desired.In terms of visual and audio elements, \"Kong and Godzilla: The New Empire\" does have some redeeming qualities. The CGI is generally well-executed, and the monster designs are impressive. However, these aspects alone cannot compensate for the film's many shortcomings.In conclusion, \"Kong and Godzilla: The New Empire\" is a major disappointment. It fails to capture the magic and excitement that made previous entries in the franchise enjoyable. With a nonsensical plot, lackluster action, and forgettable characters, this film is a chore to sit through. Save your time and money; this empire is not worth visiting.\n\n                    6 out of 6 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

The soundtrack not only enhances the emotional depth of the film but also succeeds in creating in some moments genuine goosebumps. The sound design really enhances this impact by carefully using sound pans, bass, and reverse effects. It creates a sense of tension and immersion which is one of the film's strongest features.The Mixed:Visual Effects and Costume Design: Some of the visual effects in \"Madame Web\" were visually appealing. The costume design, like Casey's red jacket and the three spider girl villain outfits standing out as particularly stunning contributions to the film's aesthetic, but it was not often shown in the film since the films direction and focus was different. I was disappointed.Acting and Direction: Although I thought Casey's character development - her ability to see the world from a different perspective - was great, I didn't like how it was visually presented. The way it was edited was poorly done. The editor could use 2 distinct color grading features where one sees the future and two, she sees the present moment.However, The performances throughout the film feel lackluster, with the actors appearing confused and disengaged. This, combined with direction that fails to maintain interest or coherence in many scenes, significantly undermines the film's potential.Negatives:Cinematography: Cinematography is bad since some pictures don't show a clear image. The camera moves so fast that I cannot comprehend the picture. I kind of recognized that it tries to initiate the rapidness of the events from the spider's eye point of view but it was a tasteless decision. The Cinematography is not something like wow. The reason why Cinematography was lacking is because it was heavily based on medium closeups and dutch tilts which on one hand was a unique choice but on the other hand very hard to watch. I found the 180 degree round camera rotations super cool, but again, I expected varied distance shots, not just medium shots. The train scene Cinematography was the best in the film.Editing and Pace: The editing is arguably the weakest element of \"Madame Web,\" with its rapid cuts and disjointed flow detracting significantly from the storytelling. This lack of coherence makes it challenging for the audience to fully engage with the narrative.Plot and Overall Execution: The storyline of \"Madame Web\" is cluttered and clichéd, suffering from a lack of originality and clear direction. The film's ambition is evident, but the execution falls short of creating a compelling narrative.The Conclusion:\"Madame Web\" presents a paradoxical experience, with exceptional music and sound design standing that sharply contrasts with its various flaws in editing, cinematography, and direction.Although there are some visually and emotionally stunning moments, they are frequently overshadowed by a lack of coherence and clarity.Also, I think this film would be reasonable and great to be incorporated in a TV series which would have allowed for a more in-depth exploration of characters and plot.Nevertheless, Madame Web is a bit of a mixed bag, with moments of potential that ultimately leave the viewer something different visually.Rating: 3/10.\n\n                    325 out of 431 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

The messy script creates poor dialogue from the cast and the characters are not interesting. The special effects looked even worse than the marketing and all of the performances were pretty bad. I honestly do feel bad for Dakota Johnson cause she is a good actress but she deserves to have better roles then this. It can be said for the same for the rest of the cast members.The uses of product placements are annoying, action moments are dull, and and all in all, it was boring. Superhero movies shouldn't be boring but this really dragged on.

I did find the antagonist's performance pretty stilted. The story basically plays like a slasher/Terminator flick where the antagonist is a \"Spider-Man\" instead of a robot. I personally found the idea interesting, and the movie did a pretty good job fleshing it out. Though there is the possibility of a sequel/crossover, I guess the studio isn't hopeful, as there was no post-credits scene. It would've been interesting seeing her reactions meeting up with the MCU Spider-Man, but I won't get my hopes up.\n\n                    71 out of 101 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

But there is some really bad campy acting happening on her part, reminiscent of the Fifty Shades of Grey movies in which she starred. Perhaps it was because the director was more interested in the placement of Pepsi cans than her performance, but I digress.Basically, this movie plays out like the cut scenes from a budget Xbox 360 game. From the ground up this thing just feels designed to fail. It feels almost Producersesque in its approach in just how every aspect is seemingly intentionally mangled, yet no one seems to care. How have we come so full circle to go through the glory of Infinity War/Logan/The Dark Knight to arrive all the way back to Batman and Robin and Catwoman levels of superhero flicks? (Bam!, Pow!, Gosh yes Batman!)How did this movie make it so far that it has an actual release, and no one stopped it? How did this idea get green lit? Why did Sony give 80 million and turn over their valuable IP to the people that wrote Morbius, Gods of Egypt, Dracula Untold and The Last Witch Hunter? How did this get past the writing process and again have that script greenlit? How could no one on the set at any point stop things? How did no one in the editing room point out how bad it looked and how much of a mess it was?But to the suits it's not about art and story. Instead it's about business, and people are just a commodity. It's cheaper to recycle known quantities, and practice nepotism and involve maybe less than talented friends, people you've worked with before, than go out and find artists with worthy stories. They don't care about art, they don't care about stories, they care about making this work for them financially, regardless of loss of reputation with audiences as a whole.Youtuber Chris Stuckmann did a deep dive on the topic of big studios being generally run by folks who came up through management rather than the creative rungs such as writing and directing when he discussed this film. His take is worth watching. For some reason, Chris doesn't do critical movie reviews since he has become a filmmaker, but I can tell by his tone that, like me, he was completely displeased watching this one. I'd avoid it.\n\n                    400 out of 520 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "Horrible from beginning to end, the opening scene just reeks of awful predictability from story & plot to the core. You know exactly what will happen before it even happens, the script sucks & the dialogue is even worse. There is quite noticeable audio dub edited after the fact too. This budget is 80 million, not that budget matters, because no amount of money could have saved this train wreck, but I mention this because you can still make a good film on lower budgets, Shazam, the first one, had the same budget & delt with a lot of side characters too, it's miles better, Godzilla minus one had a extremely low budget too. But this 80 million dollar film not just effects but production, feels obviously cheap, it almost feels like watching a very long pilot episode to a CW tv show.You thought Morbius was bad, that film was bad because it did the bare minimum, this film doesn't even do the bare minimum, it goes beyond comprehension below that, it just enters a point of no originality or ambition towards creating anything. There isn't even a single superhero moment, even horrible films like catwoman or Morbius has superhero moments & action, this thing doesn't, you get instead visions of the future to potentially set up sequels.This movie also has a serious problem of product placement, it's a long commercial, to be exact a long Pepsi commercial, I feel like Pepsi stopped the halftime show so they could invest in the product placement in this film. This movie was more important to them than the superbowl LOL it's just so over the top & obviously placed way too much in this film. Calvin Klein, Chase bank, the list goes on. This movie should be called superhero product placement the movie.It's barely even close to a 1/10 the cool moments are seeing what we already saw in the trailer when she's seeing the future & you think it's happening now but then it goes back to the moment she realizes it's a vision, granted it's cool the first couple times but it gets old REAL quick. & it ends up getting annoying because it's abused way too much.Thats about it, there isn't any redeeming things in this film, the acting isn't even good. I would say the 3 side character spider women that Dakota finds when they are together there was a potential spark. I saw the talent & potential, but they are failed big time by such a horrid script that the spark never even sparks, it's just like showing you the matches & gasoline & not setting the fire.Madame M0RBIUS / 10.\n\n                    351 out of 483 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "Based on Madame Web's woeful reviews I was expecting this film to be an utter car crash. To its credit I will say it isn't entirely without merit, but it is incredibly boring and bland.Mostly this is because nothing particularly happens. It's a superhero movie with little to no superhero action and a painfully long set up for an underwhelming final act. The characters are so underdeveloped that there is no emotional connection or investment in any of them. Everything about the story and writing just feels lazy, vacuous and corny.Then there's the villain who is utterly uninspiring. He is constantly complaining about 'everything he has built' being destroyed. What has he built you might ask? The film has no interest in exploring this question. He's easily one of the more two dimensional and weak superhero villains I've ever seen committed to screen.Perhaps the most heinous crime this movie commits is to waste the talents of Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Adam Scott, Emma Roberts, Zosia Mamet and more. Such a good cast was assembled and they were given absolutely nothing to work with, so I don't blame the performers. It's just such a shame to see such great talent put to the sword like this.As if all of this wasn't enough, the movie also feels remarkably low budget and feels excruciatingly long despite its relatively short runtime.Ultimately I think this film suffered because it was clearly intended as a set up for a wider Spider-Woman franchise which is unlikely to come to fruition. There seemed to be no interest in making a good stand alone movie, and no respect for the audience. A massive waste of time.\n\n                    163 out of 219 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Detaching oneself from the expectation of a seamless integration into the broader MCU narrative allows for a more enjoyable viewing experience. While it may not reach the heights of some of its counterparts, the film still manages to deliver an entertaining ride, filled with enough thrills and excitement to keep audiences engaged. At its core, cinema is about escapism, and \"Madame Web\" certainly accomplishes that goal, providing viewers with a welcome respite from reality for its runtime. Criticisms of the film seem misplaced when compared to the mindless entertainment found in other media forms like reality TV. In the end, \"Madame Web\" deserves credit for its efforts to bring a lesser-known character to the forefront and provide audiences with a dose of enjoyable escapism. So, before casting judgment, perhaps it's worth considering the simple pleasure of having fun at the movies, regardless of whether it meets every critic's lofty expectations. So chill out haters.

It's that bad. It's absolutely fascinating to behold.Now, I'll be honest with you here. I only went to see this because I had heard it was an unmitigated disaster that had to be seen to be believed, and it truly does not disappoint - or massively does, depending on your viewpoint.It takes a special kind of director to get such cringe-inducing performances out of a fairly talented cast (Dakota Johnson and Tahar Rahim are both quality actors with the right script and direction), but SJ Clarkson somehow manages to wrangle the absolute worst imaginable from every single person in the film. I'll be very surprised if she ever does another feature after this.Nothing in this film works; the plot is moronic, the script seems like it was written by a teenager, the cinematography is horrendous, the aformentioned embarrassing performances, the audio editing is baffling (so much dubbing, brain-melting music choices). I'm amazed this didn't get shelved the minute the final cut was done.To me, I rate this as \"so bad it's good\" as I wasn't bored watching it, but most people I assume will say it's just plain bad... and it is, but very entertainingly so.If you love watching a 2hr car crash then I highly recommend this. The awfulness is mind-boggling in it's complexity, but in the best possible way. Film scholars and historians will be analysing this movie for years to come, and I hope it is talked about in the same vein as The Room in the future.An absolutely epic misfire on all levels.\n\n                    230 out of 317 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "There's some sort of madness that sweeps over movie critics and movie fans every so often. Some pundit, reviewer, influencer or other nitwit sounds off about how feeble, terrible, horribly BAD a movie is (or is *going* to be - these opinions often predate any viewing of the actual movie). And then the herd instinct takes over and generates a tsunami of contempt.Case in point, Madame Web - a truly ridiculous number of one-star reviews, completely unjustified by the actual experience of watching the movie.The surprising truth is that this is actually quite a decent little movie. It's no work of genius, but it is a workmanlike, efficient, competent piece of entertainment. Not only is it not \"the worst,\" it is far more entertaining than a whole host of bloated, forgettable superhero flicks of the past few years.Start with the characters. We have an interesting heroine, Cassandra Webb, nicely embodied by Dakota Johnson. She's likeable, believable and suitably challenged by events she doesn't really understand. I can't speak to Johnson's acting range, not having seen her in anything else, but she seems to fit this particular part perfectly.Most of the movie has to do with Cassandra's attempts to protect three teen-age girls. All three of them are presented as distinct personalities, and are elevated beyond mere stereotypes by earnest and appealing performances by the trio of actresses. I not only believed them, I was happy to spend time with them.Then there's the story. It's nothing we haven't seen before, but it's done well. The origin of Cassandra's odd powers is novel, and revealed in stages that keep us guessing. Refreshingly, Cassandra needs to hold a super-villain at bay without actually knowing there's such a thing as a super-hero movie - or that she's in one.Better yet, Cassandra's super-talent is inherently unpredictable, in an interesting way. It reminded me of the excellent Nicolas Cage film Next, in which he has the ability to see the future - two minutes at a time. The storyline of Madame Web is somewhat formulaic, to be sure - but it's a good formula, and well-executed. I never felt my intelligence was being insulted, and I certainly never felt bored.The inevitable computer effects are used sparingly. Action is kept on a human scale - far more engrossing than watching CG heroes destroying planets with their pinky fingers.I tip-toed into Madame Web with dire forebodings of a wasted evening. Two hours later I found myself wishing the movie was longer - and wondering what ghastly childhood traumas must have prompted the vast torrents of vitriol that have been aimed at it.Sure, Madame Web isn't a breakthrough of any kind. But it's a completely professional piece of work - a solid two hours' escape from the troubles of the real world. Maybe it doesn't follow the comics - I don't know, and couldn't possibly care less. Maybe there were some nasty studio conflicts during production - again, not my concern. The end result was good. I had fun. Unless you come in solidly determined to hate, I can't see why you wouldn't have fun too.Rating: 8 out of 10. To me, 7 indicates a movie that succeeds in its aims - that entertains and does nothing conspicuously off-putting, worth seeing for anyone who likes the genre. However, I felt compelled to add an extra mercy star to offset the numerous undeservedly low ratings.\n\n                    179 out of 299 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

It's a clunky, poorly-written, messy, and sloppy movie packed with some mediocre editing and performances.The concept is interesting on paper, but it couldn't be saved due to it's terrible execution. \"Madame Web\" simply lacked the spark it needed in nearly every dept.There is simply nothing memorable in this movie, except maybe some superhero costumes, but that doesn't redeem the fact that the movie is bad.So yeah...\"Madame Web\" is yet another disappointing entry in the Sony's Spider-Less universe. It's like a love letter to an era of superhero films that people largely want to forget. The \"Pepsi\" adds are stand-out, it falls short of what could have been a decent movie in the hands of someone else twenty years ago.\n\n                    264 out of 376 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Despite having a budget of 80 million dollars, the movie feels low budget. Was not to the level of a modern marvel film but more like a marvel tv show.The characters were not as well established or as likable as they could of been. It was cluttered and cliche and suffers form a lack of originality. The cast deserved better, wasted talents of Dakota Johnson and Sydney Sweeney. The villain was generic and uninspiring. Constantly complaining about \"everything he as built' being destroyed, while not showing anything that he has built.Im not fully up on the real origin story but after looking into it more it seems Sony fully molested the comic book version for their own that barely resembles anything of the original. I see why that would make many purist upset. That would help explain a current rating of 3.7, which is crazy considering all the far worse films with higher ratings. I was entertained watching this film but that is with the caveat that this was not a good or very well made movie. The film fell flat on the execution of creating a compelling narrative.The pepsi product placement rivaled the pepsi placement in the \"I will not bow to any sponsor\" scene in Wayne's World. \"Its like people only do things because they get paid, and its really sad\" -Garth.\n\n                    50 out of 68 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

I'm sure there are plot holes aplenty (I noticed a few) and it probably makes zero sense/isn't a good adaptation compared to its source material or whatever but honesty... I don't care, it gave me enough enjoyment that I wasn't questioning anything about what I was watching.The cast are probably the key factors as to why I did enjoy this. I previously knew of Dakota Johnson but hadn't actually seen her in anything properly, I found her performance to be more than noteworthy and she spearheads the film strongly. The trio of Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor are positives too.Tahar Rahim's antagonist, meanwhile, is poorly written and portrayed, though I personally thought the actor did a good job. I have no complaints with anyone who appears onscreen to be honest. Away from them, the pacing and score are also standouts.In my recollection of viewing this, I truthfully haven't got any issues with it. If it wasn't for the slight bad murmurs that I did hear about pre-watch (though not much of it as I avoid as much as I can with movies) and the reaction on sites like this post-watch, I'd not be questioning my thoughts about this whatsoever.As I always say, to each their own.

                "Title": "Writers produce messy, tired work without really knowing what to do with it.",
                "Content": "Madame Web is a new spin-off set in the Marvel Spider-Man world. This spin-off is directed, partly written and produced by S. J. Clarkson. Before this film, she directed more TV series episodes of superhero shows such as Jessica Jones and The Defenders.Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) works as a paramedic in New York and learns after an accident that she has superpowers to see future possibilities. She sees that the lives of three girls are threatened by a mysterious masked man with spider-like powers.This is why she tries to protect the three girls and must convince them that their lives are really in danger. To truly protect them, they must ensure that the three listen to her and learn to work together.The story of this film has an interesting concept, but the final story and screenplay were written by five different writers. These writers do not always seem to have been on the same page, because the story sometimes seems a bit rushed or frayed. It sometimes seems as if they didn't really know what exactly to do with it, or what the film studio despised of them. The screenplay has also been rewritten many times, so the cast members could no longer always follow exactly where they were going or supposed to do with the film.Despite these messy, rushed aspects, the film remains on a familiar, predictable side for a superhero film. This can make the film seem a bit long-winded or embarrassing. The film is reminiscent of other superhero films that came out around the year 2000, but of a somewhat lesser quality.The visual effects don't always look believable either. The blue screen and CGI can be seen in the film. For some of the cast members, this was also the first time they had actually worked in a film with such visual effects. The fact that they have little or no experience with these film situations is sometimes reflected in their acting.The poor script also gives the cast members few opportunities to make something special of their roles. Dakota Johnson also seemed a bit uncomfortable during promotions of the film, or ignorant of how to properly promote this film. In the final film she tries to make the best of the role and tries to add some comedy to the role, but she doesn't always get the chance to do this. Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor play the three girls Cassandra tries to protect. All three are given a little time to give their characters some personalities, but unfortunately not enough to make you as a viewer really care about the three. For a better focused film, they might have been better off using a character in the story, who Cassandra then has to protect. Tahar Rahim plays the villain in the film, who tries to kill the three girls, but also deals with the poor, weak script. As a result, he does not emerge as strongly as the villain of the story. They also didn't incorporate his audio work well into the film, because his lips sometimes don't always match what his character is saying.With all these superhero spin-off films from the Sony film studio, they only make Marvel's current film series more messy. If Sony and Disney Marvel try to collaborate on the same film series, they will have to consult each other more and better and plan where they want to go with this film series.\n\n                    98 out of 149 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "I'm not ashamed to admit I've seen some movies in my time.I am however ashamed to admit curiosity got the better of me and I ended up in an almost entirely empty cinema screening (thanks to one tolerant movie buddy who joined me on my trip to the local cinema) partaking in what can only be described as one of the most universally panned Hollywood blockbusters of the modern era.Not at all interested in watching another Sony Marvel outing after their last few efforts, hearing about the insanely awesome awfulness of Madame Web from friends, internet identities and esteemed critics made me want to witness a potential all-time cringe-fest and while when people are absolutely right in their hyperbole around just how bad Madame Web is, I'm still trying to comprehend how I could possibly testify to just how bad things are here.Directed by long time TV episode director S. J. Clarkson and featuring a cast of performers who have all proven over time to be more than capable of bringing the goods, Madame Web is not devoid of talent that may have been able to salvage some type of goodness from an offence against the entire cinematic medium but as a finished? (Honestly I am unsure how anyone could claim this is an acceptable final version, just watch for some of the most flawed examples of ADR you're ever going to see) product there was no one or any thing that could've saved this nightmare from the fate it had created for itself.An experience that could only possibly come from a collective group who all gave up the fight to save it long before shooting had wrapped, Madame Web inexcusably comes from the same penmanship that was guilty of unleashing Morbius on us but screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless at least managed to find some cult like goodness in Jared Leto and Matt Smith's wildly OTT characters and bizarre action segments but Madame Web is nothing more than two hours of terrible plot, characters, spectacle and intentions and there is quite literally no valid reason for this movie to exist in the form it has been given.One of the most atrociously acted Hollywood films ever captured, with lead Dakota Johnson unable to hold back her disdain for a film she clearly hated being a part of and poor old Tahar Rahim taking the films most unfortunate mantle from a wigged Sydney Sweeney, Madame Web may have been promoted as some type of intense action thriller following the exploits of Johnson's Cassandra Webb as she battles Rahim's Ezekiel Sims alongside Sweeney's Julia, Isabela Merced's Anya and Celeste O'Connor's Mattie but we get something else entirely that is hard to come to terms with.From some of the most detestable and frequent examples of product placement that becomes instantly iconic (some viewers may find themselves attempting to crack open a Pepsi can in their Calvin Klein's after a viewing), a villain we literally know nothing about with zero attempts to bother explaining his plans or background, an embarrassing use of comic staple characters that aren't even put into action outside of dream sequences and a script that must surely have been conjured on ChatGPT, Madame Web is a cesspool of Hollywood excrement that isn't even funny in its horribleness, just merely sad and depressing.The only justifiable reason for Madame Web to be the film it is as it stands is if Sony are deliberately attempting to sabotage their Marvel property that no longer is allowed to include many fan favourites, if they aren't in fact doing that there is zero excuses for why Madame Web has ever been allowed to be birthed into existence.An irredeemable, amateurish and embarrassing exercise in pointless, Madame Web is a shockingly bad example of blockbuster filmmaking that is the exact type of bottom feeder product the cinema industry and the Marvel brand didn't need at this particular point of time.Final Say -If you're a glutton for punishment and want to be reminded of everything you wouldn't wish to see in a supposed piece of big screen entertainment then Madame Web is for you! A truly iconic new addition to the staples of all-time misfires, nothing could prepare one for the garbage that is this $80 million dollar disasterpiece.0 fireworks to the head out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)\n\n                    72 out of 112 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Dune, the book drives on the thoughts and inner emotions of the characters - the things that are left unsaid. Visually, that can only be adapted to a certain extent.Villeneuve has done a better job than anyone could ask for. I think he had to compromise on not bringing even more details to the movie, considering that the majority of the people will not have read the book. The information overload would have been difficult to follow for most.This movie is definitely slow, so if you are accustomed to constant dopamine stimulation then you might find it boring.The visuals in combination with the sound/music are hauntingly beautiful and will stick in your mind for a long time. I got goosebumps almost throughout the entire movie.Dune: Part One definitely serves as a stepping stone for Dune: Part Two, and more to come...\nIf you are looking for action, Dune: Part Two is definitely the movie to be waiting for. So grab some friends and go watch this movie.Make \"Dune: Part Two\" happen.This is only the beginning.\n\n                    807 out of 1,027 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Paul surprised, Leto was decent, Duncan was solid but slightly too much Hollywood. The storyline slowly opened up, just like the novel.

                "Content": "This movie is big. It's meant to be on the big screen. The visuals are captivating, the music is mesmerizing and the actors are convincing.This is an adaptation of the Dune novel from 1965, and it covers about half the book. I have read the novel long ago, but I'm mostly familiar with the Dune universe from the Command & Conquer game Emperor: Battle for Dune. It's a vast universe with politics, religion, tribes and houses. The movie does an excellent job of placing you in this grand setting without over-explaining everything, but also without feeling completely lost. For someone new to the Dune universe you can easily recognize who the \"good\" and \"bad\" guys are and follow the plot, without knowing who all the different names refer to. But it's not dumbed down so that those who will recognize the names feel patronized. This is very hard to pull off, but I think this movie did so masterfully.I would describe it as a mixture between Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. You follow individuals in a grand and complex world. The majority of the movie takes place on a desert planet, so it really needed an amazing soundtrack to elevate the experience - and it has. Hans Zimmer turned down Tenet to work on Dune, and I think he made the right choice.However, this is only \"Part 1\", as it says in the beginning of the movie, so you know it won't be a complete story. I was ready to watch Part 2 as soon as it ended, but will have to wait. LOTR The fellowship of the Ring would be an insignificant movie without The two towers and The return of a king to complete the story. Together they are great, individually they are not enough. So it is with Dune - It is a great introduction, but it desperately needs a part 2 to conclude the story. And there better be a Part 2!\n\n                    340 out of 441 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Unfortunately while the film looked great and was faithful to a few of the scenes, it failed dreadfully to bring any depth to the story. There is no background to speak of with any of the characters who appear and disappear as quickly as they came. From this point of view it has to be seen as a failure, both for people who have read the book and find it lacking. And those who haven't, who either won't get it at all, or will see some weak mystical Matrix / Star Wars type hybrid.Disappointed with this, I think I'll seek out the series.\n\n                    26 out of 29 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "As a fan of the book, I really wanted to like Dune. And perhaps as a fan of the book my expectations were too high. Dune had the potential to be one of the great films of recent times. The material - if difficult to adapt - is there. Themes that, despite the book's publication date of 1965, seem ever so relevant today: natural resource exploitation to the detriment of the environment; drug addiction and its geo-political consequences; rebellion against colonial occupation; the power of religion as a political tool; a cautionary perspective on the western hero journey. This story could have hit a serious chord with today's audiences. Alas, Villeneuve's film depicts the plot of Dune, but fails to tell its story. It marches through the plot points, bringing them to life with impressive visual style, but fails to hone in on the themes above. We're left with a solid sci-fi adventure that really could have been so much more.It's possible Villeneuve was not the right director for this adaptation, despite his professed love for the book. He is no doubt an accomplished director with a strong track record, but I always suspected he was more of a technical maestro than an emotive storyteller, and Dune seems to confirm that. In the end, there is a shortage of scenes that are memorable on an emotional level. Furthermore, there is a serious lost opportunity to inject suspense into the first act of the film, instead turning it into a plodding exercise in exposition. Thus the feeling of fatalism that pervades the book is nowhere to be found. Character moments which would have required no additional screen time, such as Gurney's penchant for singing, are lost, and the character development suffers as a result. Equally confounding is the lack of focus on the spice, which really should have been a \"character\" in its own right.My other major gripe is with the score and pacing, which feed off one another. Pounding, rhythmic scores like Hans Zimmer's seem to be all the rage these days, but am I passé for wanting a melodic refrain that emotionally reinforces the climactic moments? Once it gets going, Zimmer's score never lets up and never gives the audience a chance to catch their breath. The pacing gets stuck in one speed with no time to dwell on the important moments, a surprising blunder for a director you would expect to know the value of varying pitch and tone. To be fair, Dune is not an easy book to adapt, and properly telling this tale probably required more runtime than the studio was willing to stomach. However, I still would have expected Villeneuve's passion for the material to run a bit deeper than surface level.--You can get more reviews from me at my substack Haremonious Sounds.\n\n                    41 out of 48 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

So it ends at the moment the mythology is just picking up. Which made me leave the cinema wishing to see part two, which unfortunately they haven't even started filming.So IMHO the reviews giving this movie a 10 or calling it the movie of the year are overly positive. It's a visually stunning start to a potentially mind blowing universe, but mainly an introduction to that universe. Maybe when the story is finished (wouldn't surprise me if they need three movies for the first book) it will be mind blowing and perfect, but for now this movie is a great introduction to the duneverse.

The cast. Some the best actors working today. Stellan Skarsgard's Baron Harkonen channels Brando's Colonel Kurtz quite well. Special effects. Top notch. Music, properly grandiose.You know what can't be said about DUNE PART 1?That it's any fun. Or that it's entertaining.Timothy Chalemet has zero charisma and zero chemistry with Zendaya. I still don't get why he's such a big star at the moment. Maybe it's just me...Some don't recall David Lynch's 1984 version with the fondness it deserves. And while a bit jumbled at times. Somewhat hard to understand at others. During its original theatrical run a glossary page was handed to movie goers before each screening. (Wish o had one of those!)But it was tight. It was weird and wonderful in a way that the new version fails to be. Lynch took roughly the same amount of time to give us an adaptation of the whole novel. And it was an entertaining and engrossing cinematic ride.By stretching the source material to two films, it creates boredom where there should be excitement. Scenes go on and on, when they clearly don't need to. I found myself expecting the credits to roll for the last twenty-five minutes or so of Villeneuve's film. And when Chani finally gave the (incredibly predictable) last line of the film, I breathed a sigh of relief.I'm gonna go watch Lynch's version now.That is all.-SmokeyKorzeniowski.\n\n                    21 out of 24 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

But I never knew nothing of Harry Potter, Hunger games, Lord of the rings, game of thrones, maze runner etc etc before watching any of them and still enjoyed all of them.\n\n                    42 out of 47 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Title": "A great immersive and psychological experience",
                "Content": "Visual:\nI don't think I've ever been so impressed in front of a movie. The visual of the film is amazing. The attention to detail and the realism of the world portrayed on screen is impressive. I was more than once impressed and gripped to my seat in front of some visuals (especially those related to the sandworm). The special effects, the way of filming and the precision on some details allow a total immersion in the world of Dune. You could almost touch the quicksand with your fingers.The sandworm is definitely the best visual thing I've seen. The realism of the sand waves created by the worm is astounding and gives a real sense of danger and wonder. In fact, the film creates the necessary tension around this creature. I had never been especially terrified or fascinated by the worm before seeing this movie.I also particularly liked the richness of the Fremen universe that this film shows. The different equipments used to survive in the desert make it possible to understand the hostility of the environment as well as why the Fremen are dangerous and particular because they have managed to adapt and live with the desert not just in terms of climate but in term equipments. These are the kind of details that enrich the universe.Sound:\nSound does not have the musical function it often has in films. It is a real prop to immerse the viewer in the universe, underlining an action, a noise and the like. The rumblings, tremors, pulses felt make the world of Dune alive, captivating and make it a real 4DX experience in a normal theater.Story:\nThe story of the film is very well constructed. The director takes the time to set the scene, introduce the universe and put the characters in their comfort zone before launching the plot. This time given to the exposure of the world and the characters allows the audience to understand the issues at hand, to know the different relationships and what is going on in the minds of the characters (mainly the character of Paul).The film builds a palpable but subtle tension throughout its first arc which leads us to the mid-film climax. The pace doesn't slow down after that. The film subtly and dynamically alternates action scenes with more poised ones. The action is present and well paced without being omnipresent and does not suffocate the audience with endless sequences without emotions. The film is understandable for everyone. It takes the time to present the different political factions and the issues while maintaining a little mystery about some political actors.The ending, although very open, fit with the story told in this first part and gives a feeling of accomplishment of a quest while making the audience understand that nothing is finished, far from there.Characters:\nAll characters serve their purpose. The ones that revolve around the Atreides are specially well written. Each has their own personality, function and relationship to other characters. The acting combined with the writing allows the audience to become attached to these various characters, to understand them, to have empathy for them and to fear for their lives.The main character, Paul Atreides, is written with a lot of subtlety, complexity and emotion. Everything is done, including the acting, so that the audience understands and sympathizes with this affectionate teenager, still immature and lacking in self-confidence, who is aware he must grow up and try to live up to his position as heir to a Duke. This complicated period between childhood and adulthood is well portrayed on screen. To this gradually comes to add an understanding of his difference. And the audience feels a great pity to see him progressively become someone he doesn't want to be and be thrown into a path he doesn't want to take.Lady Jessica, the film's second leading role, embodies with great charisma and subtlety the mysterious aura of her order. Alternately self-confident, emotional, stoic and badass, she is a complex character that is still a little mysterious but terribly human and understandable. The mother and son bond is also well exploited on the screen.The Harkonnen are not caricatured but frightening and cruel.Conclusion:\nDune by Denis Villeneuve is a very good film, even an excellent film. It is rare to succeed in combining visual, sound and storyline without it being to the detriment of one of these elements. It's also complicated to make an adaptation of a book that satisfies both readers and non-readers. And this bet was successful. Non-readers will not understand everything at 100%, but the film gives them enough to understand most of what it says. The rest can remain a mystery, understandable after a second viewing or when Part 2 airs.After all, when the first Star Wars came out, not everyone understood what the Jedi, the Force, the Emperor and the like were, but that didn't stop us from enjoying the adventure. Here, since the film is intended to be more political and immersive, the audience has a lot more information and explanations.Dune is a real sci-fi rodeo. It is a science fiction movie, a Greek tragedy, an art's movie and a blockbuster. This is an immersive and psychological experience that will not leave the audience untouched.\n\n                    71 out of 88 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Visually stunning, Action was good, well directed. Acting was very believable.I haven't read the book and i really liked the movie. Made me curious to learn more about characters and world, but it was very solid first chapter in my opinion. I'm pretty sure others who haven't read the book can get hooked as well, because even if you don't know anything about it, who doesn't like epic looking spaceships and giant sandworms?To elaborate even further, i think this movie will win over lots of Star Wars fans, who have been disappointed in Star Wars in recent years. Unlike Disney Star Wars, Dune is way more mature and has actually deep lore and interesting characters.\n\n                    337 out of 447 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

He often allowed them to improvise while the camera were rolling. He secretly told Will to call Lawrence a bitch before the car-scene. The whole \"two bitches in the sea\" was improvised, as was Martin's comment when Téa Leoni called him gay.",

                "Content": "The honest and efficient Detective Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) is a married cop with three children, having difficulties for the payment of his mortgage and for having sex with his wife. His partner is the also honest, efficient and wealthy Detective Mike Lowrey (Will Smith), who inherits a large amount from his family and although living like a playboy, has not resigned to his position in the police department. After a daring robbery of heroin from the police department stores, the two detectives try to find some clue about the gang. The chance appears with the hooker Julie Mott (Téa Leoni), the witness of the murder of a 'working girl' friend of her. The detectives are assigned to protect her and chase the killers. Although full of clichés, 'Bad Boys' is an excellent action movie, in the same line of 'Lethal Weapon'. There are lots of funny parts, Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are excellent as the two partners with different behaviors and Téa Leoni is gorgeous. I saw this movie a couple of years ago, when Will Smith was an unknown actor, and now I saw it again on DVD, with the intention of watching 'Bad Boys II'. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): 'Os Bad Boys' ('The Bad Boys')\n\n                    61 out of 88 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Title": "Pretty entertaining buddy comedy",
                "Content": "The 'buddy comedy' genre is fairly well-known, there have been plenty of them, all of them primarily based on the basic idea of having two main characters who are, well, buddies; they act like friends to each other, they get in fights, they help each other out, they compliment each other. It's a fairly easy genre to master, and an easy way to make a good movie. This is one of the best examples, since Smith and Lawrence really do compliment each other so well; Smith's the sleek, cool one who is popular with the ladies, while Lawrence is often nervous, and pretty much a direct opposite of Smith. They have pretty good on-screen chemistry, too; you believe that these are good friends and partners. My only real problem with the film is the way the comedy almost all is generated by stereotypes, and, worse, the age-old complications that arise from certain situations. I think that's a little unoriginal, but, hey, that's the only complaint about it, and the film does have some very entertaining comedy parts. The plot is pretty good, it keeps the film going and supplies every single scene with comedy, action, or both. It takes off immediately, and keeps a good pace throughout the 2 hour duration. The acting is all pretty good. The characters are well-written, well, for stereotypes at least(because, lets face it; they are). The comedy is well-done and often made me laugh out loud, and, believe me, I am not, in any way, shape or form, a Will Smith fan. The action was well-done too, intense and exciting. The film, all in all, was pretty good, very entertaining. For a buddy comedy, it's good. For an action comedy, it's good too. I recommend it to all fans of action comedies, and buddy comedies. 7/10\n\n                    53 out of 77 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "I had no high hopes when I walked into this film.  I like Will Smith, I like Martin Lawrence, so I figured this film will at least be funny.  And it was funny, and then some.  It was action packed, thrilling and a helluva good time.  I came out of the theatre thinking that the guy who directed that movie is going to be huge.Michael Bay, former music video and commercial director, has made an incredible directorial debut.  The film never stops.  When it isn't action-packed, it is funny.  It is sexy, fun and always moving.  Christian Wagner's editing is phenomenal.  I love action movies that really try to be action movies.  A lot of action films know that they are action films so they try to incorporate other genres to make the film more complete, but they often fail miserably.  They try so hard to be something they are not that they forget what they are in the first place. The essence of the action film is the action. It is a necessary component, it needs to be there otherwise it loses its edge. \"Bad Boys\" doesn't just throw in the occassional action sequence to meet the expectations of the genre, but instead uses the action to help tell the story.  It is this use of filmmaking that allows an action film to remain an action film and still go beyond.Watch \"Bad Boys\" again and every time there is an action sequence, ask yourself why that was there and what did it accomplish.  You will find that each sequence took the film to another level; it introduced an new conflict, it increased the present conflict, it eliminated a key character, it introduced a new character, and so on.  There are a lot of action films out there that sacrifice story for spectacle, and the audience notices this.  At the centre of all films lies the story and if it comes to a halt so does the interest of the viewers.\"Bad Boys\" of course isn't the greatest story on film, or even in the action genre, but what is so appealing and memorable about \"Bad Boys\" is that it is just as entertaining with its story as it is with its action by combining the two without sacrificing either.  Michael Bay understands the importance of the story within the structure of the film.  He tells a visual story, entertaining and complete, and leaves you very satisfied. Watch for Michael Bay because he is here to stay.\n\n                    81 out of 101 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "'Bad Boys (1995)' is your typical orange-and-teal, hyper-sexualised 90s action flick. It owes practically all of its success to its two stars, with Lawrence and Smith's constant banter being pretty much the only interesting thing in the entire affair. I mean, it's not like the movie is boring or anything. It's just very by the numbers and isn't all that compelling. It's entertaining enough, I suppose, for a bit of brainless fun, and I will admit that it has one or two genuine laughs. Most of it is just pure nonsense, though. The plot, for instance, is all over the place. It's almost impossible to follow, in a sense, because it just sort of happens. At the same time, it isn't all that important. The flick's focus is certainly on the odd 'in disguise as each other' dynamic that keeps its charismatic leads on their toes. Their relationship is a decent amount of fun, but it's a bit frustrating because it never really evolves (and barely has any consequences). Still, it gives the movie an undeniable charm. Ultimately, the picture is relatively enjoyable when it's underway. It's quite forgettable, though, and it isn't exactly a genre defining experience. 6/10.\n\n                    7 out of 10 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "Bad Boys is a great action comedy from producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer. It features Will Smith (in his breakout performance) and Martin Lawrence, an unlikely pair who quite simply are the best movie duo I've seen since Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker in Rush Hour. The film features incredible action sequences (i.e. the Ether truck chase scene featuring massive explosions and pervasive gun fights) which all lead up to the film's action-packed climax which could only be done in a Jerry Bruckheimer film. The film also stars Tea Leoni (who is pretty good in playing the damsel in distress), Joe Pantoliano (whom we all know as Ralphie on The Sopranos, as a police captain) and Tcheky Karyo as the villain. (He was also the French officer opposite Mel Gibson in 2000's The Patriot) The movie features comedic one-liners from Smith and Lawrence as well as a few by Leoni. It also features a few sex jokes and just plain \"disses\". However, the characters are so underdeveloped that all we are left with is action and comedy. This formula is also seen in the recent summer blockbuster Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, in which we could care less about the characters and just look for the action. However, Simpson and Bruckheimer's Bad Boys succeeds where T3 does not. By the end of the movie, we care about the heroes because they are fun to watch. In T3, the great Ah-nuld is just a figurehead for a movie romped with action-packed sequences and jaw-dropping stunts. This is one of only three good Michael Bay films (right next to Pearl Harbor and The Rock) and should seen by any action movie fan.\nLenny's Grade: B\n\n                    15 out of 31 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) is a single playboy cop with lots of family money. Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) is strictly a family man. Together they are a fast-talking smart Miami buddy cop duo. Fouchet (Tchéky Karyo) is a wily ruthless criminal leading a crew that robs the police evidence room of a large stash of heroin. The guys need to recover the heroin before others come in to take over the case. Mike's hooker CI encounters one of the crew. She is killed while her roommate Julie Mott (Téa Leoni) witnesses the murder and escapes. She is willing to only talk to Mike, and Marcus ends up pretending to be Mike.This is Michael Bay's big screen directorial debut. He already has much of his bombastic style. The best thing in the movie has to be the brash comedy duo. The movie sizzles every time they are together. The biggest problem is the switched identity gimmick. It's stupid and the movie struggles under the premise. There is some comedy derived from it but somebody needs to come up with a better excuse for the switcharoo. This is loud. This is cool. This has a great duo. But it's also overblown.\n\n                    2 out of 3 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Title": "One of my all time favorite best action buddy cop films of my childhood, I love it to death!",
                "Content": "Bad Boys (1995) is the best Michael Bay's buddy action movie, my all time favorite buddy cop film starring Martin Lawrence and Will Smith. This is a film that I really do believe that it is a classic action movie of the 90's. This is my childhood movie my all time classic action buddy cop films honestly? I think it is MILES way better action movie than Lethal Weapon and Beverly Hills Cop, but that is just me and my opinion. I love this film to death it is my all time favorite Michael Bay film along with The Rock (1996), Transformers and Transformers: Dark of the Moon. I saw this movie probably over 10.0000 times more than the sequel, my mom bought me a VHS tape which I still have it. I bought this movie on Blu-Ray years ago and no I don't have (Mastered in 4K) I have a normal Blu-ray disc. The only thing that bothers me is a green cover which does not fit to this film. This is my all time favorite Will Smith movie I grew up watching his TV show The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (1990 - 1996) and Bad Boys become my favorite Will Smith film along side Bad Boys II and Independence Day, these are my all time favorite Will Smith movies that he did. Someday I am going to re watch Men In Black trilogy.Plot: Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are Miami Police Department detectives who find themselves protecting a murder witness while investigating a case of stolen heroin from a dangerous drug lord.The basically plot for this movie is about a 100 million dollars Heroin is stolen from the police headquarters. Two police officers have 72 hours to reclaim the heroin before the Internal Affairs Division gets involved and close their department forever and everyone on the force will lose their job. Their is a lot on stake and only one witness is ready to identify a drug dealer in return to get a justice for her murdered best friend.Why I love this film: This movie has practical everything has ton's of action, great dialogues, a few comedy scenes and a great babes including great theme scores by Mark Mancina. The chemistry between the lead is well written and I love the story off the two unlikely heroes who protect innocent people. It's filled with non-stop action. Michael Bay did a great job, it has awesome action with gory gun fights, fast car chases, massive explosions, but is still funny with Will and Martin.This is a prototypical \"good\" action movie -- intense, perfectly executed, original action, shown to the tune of a forgettable and occasionally insulting story.The final shoot-out in the airport hanger is one of my favorite action scenes from Michael Bay and it's all beautifully shot.Téa Leoni is hot, gorgeous and sexy as Julie Mott a murder witness she is so charming and beautiful heart in this movie.This film is dark and sometimes is really scary when the moment like Will Smith is attacked in pimp's dark house and thrown out of the window.Mark Mancina gives his second best score (after Speed) which also is very similar in tone. You can tell it's from the same guy. It's got a great theme tune, screeching electric guitars and some funky hip hop beats too.Tchéky Karyo almost steals the movie as the villain Fouchet; he just oozes menace and when he's on screen there is a constant threat of impending violence. Tchéky played another bad guy villain in Jet Li's Kiss of the Dragon (2001), so i saw him twice as a bad guy.The heroes in this movie are two Police Officers Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) who are well written and they are very likable. My favorite character is Mike Lowrey. I love the switch identities that was really hilarious and funny, I laughed my ass off on Martin's character.There's no shaky cam or CGI here but real explosions, Hard-R fight scenes and some nice one-liners.I love Bad Boys song on the end of the title credits performed by Inner Circle.Of course, this wouldn't be an action movie without some action. There's plenty of it, and it's perfectly done. The gunplay in this movie is delivered in a perfect Bay-Lawrence-Smith style (as opposed to the slo-mo John Woo-style) -- you'll see a lot of hand guns and heavy automatic weapons, and you'll see them used well. Hard explosions and an awesome bad ass car chase on the end of the movie! The film is violent, and bloody, but ALL of the mean-spirited violence is dealt by the evil characters, not the ones you root for (Quentin Tarantino fans: sorry). And then the truly amazing scenes that bypass acting are shocking and memorable -- just wait for the bad guy (Tchéky Karyo) been shoot to death by Will Smith on the end sequence.Splitting the difference, I am giving an 10/10 -- an outstanding score.Bad Boys is a 1995 American buddy cop action-comedy film directed by Michael Bay, produced by Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer and starring Martin Lawrence and Will Smith as two narcotic Miami detectives Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowrey. The first in the Bad Boys franchise, the film was followed by a sequel, Bad Boys II (2003).10/10 Score: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Columbia Pictures Starring: Martin Lawrence, Will Smith, Téa Leoni, Tchéky Karyo, Theresa Randle, Joe Pantoliano, Frank John Hughes, Nestor Serrano, Julio Oscar Mechoso, Kim Coates, Marg Helgenberger Director: Michael Bay Producers: Don Simpson, Jerry Bruckheimer Screenplay: Michael Barrie, Jim Mulholland, Doug Richardson Story by George Gallo Rated: R Running Time: 1 Hr. 59 Mins.

                "Title": "visually exciting, amusing and entertaining - a sexy action film",
                "Content": "Bad Boys is reminiscent of Beverley Hills Cop - it showed off LA, beautiful women, blue skies and palm lined boulevards, and this shows off Miami and looks impressive, it's shot expansively and affectionately... it's a show piece. A blockbuster - no expense spared. Lowry and Burnett (Will Smith and Martin Lawrence) are Miami PD and working on a drug bust heist from within the PD itself. It's a big film, even on a small screen you get the impression of scale, and everything is impressive. You are treated to slow motion shots accentuating our heroes in grand cinematography-style, long chases with Will Smith's shirt wide open, model-esque women everywhere, and everything is just glamorous. Tea Leoni is the \"love interest\" but in a messed up sort of way because she's in the middle of a subterfuge and Lowry and Burnett have switched roles... she witnessed her best friend get shot and is now the target, and Lowry is looking after her, except it's Burnett and his wife is MAD. It's typical action-adventure stuff; huge scenes, car chases, big stunts, car chases, explosions, wanton disregard of realistic police procedure, respect for human life or property and thinking nothing of blowing up a motorway etc ... very similar in feel to Speed, which incidentally has a very similar theme tune to Bad Boys (along with The Rock), and all three are exciting and ramp up the feeling of action. There's a lot of comedy - between Smith and Lawrence, in their fast talking brash way, then there's the sarcastic humour of their boss Joe Pantoliano (Matrix) in similar fashion to John C McGinley in Point Break, then there's the situational comedy of things being silly and going wrong and you really get the connection between Smith and Lawrence as actors - they play it well. There is a really good chemistry between them, and it's quite a bromance movie as well as action (I have no idea whether the two are friends in real life but their relationship is believable on screen). The plot is of course the least of importance in this film and is rather flimsy, but films like this are about visuals and Bad Boys is a great watch that you can watch again and again. It hasn't aged too badly - except in terms of technology (pagers and large in car phones) - and Will Smith is always a joy to watch. Tea Leoni is very good, and oddly believable in her role and her chemistry with the two actors was fun. It's a sexy film; Smith just is as he is so assured of himself, but also the chemistry between Leoni and Smith, although it's not at the forefront of the plot. It's clichéd left right and centre, of course, nothing original, or particularly challenging but not mindless, and I wouldn't be giving out any Oscars but everything comes together to create something you want to go to the cinema to see. It's a very entertaining action film with the added and lightening aspect of comedy. Generally speaking action films like this are for the boys in the audience but there is most definitely plenty in it for the girls so a win win for everyone.\n\n                    1 out of 1 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "The first instalment of the Bad Boys franchise served its purpose well, meaning it did what it was suppose to do. The score establish Michael Bay as more than a music video director, it proved black leads could spew on the fence jokes about society and still deliver at the box office and most importantly, in my opinion, catapult Will Smith into the realm of being a superstar.In all senses of the word the movie is a Hollywood classic, with grown folks alone present it would be the perfect movie to play at a family gathering. It has action, a love interest and laughs to go around at every turn. The chemistry between Martin and Will makes this movie stand out among Hollywood's well established duo action films. Always compared to that of Rush Hour.In terms of acting there were no horrendous performances, however, Will's portrayal of his character was not completely believable. At times it seemed a bit forced, as if attempting to be this hard stone playboy, then again it was his introduction to the big stage and with that perspective in mind, he did really well in regards to his prior experience.The only issue with this film for me was the film editing it did not feel cohesive enough, certain shots felt out of place and therefore made the quality of the film seem cheap. It is my belief this and a few other political ambitions and perspectives at that time in the 90's prevented it from being critically acclaimed.The crazy thing is that for me, aside from the comedy, the music and sound mixing was my favourite part of the movie. Partially biased to my Jamaican culture perhaps but the sound track and the sound editing on this film was phenomenal, then again Bay had done plenty music videos before he tried his hand in film so there is that.I also forgot to mention Martin did really well in his roll, his character protryal was believable in the sense that he really embodied that role.With all of this in mind I believe this film warrants a 6/10. Thank you for your time and I hope Bay's films continue to garner success.\n\n                    1 out of 1 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "\"Bad Boys,\" directed by Michael Bay, is a quintessential 1990s buddy cop film starring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. The movie follows Miami detectives Mike Lowrey (Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) as they work to recover a stolen cache of heroin while protecting a key witness.Smith and Lawrence's chemistry is the film's strongest asset, with their witty banter and contrasting personalities providing much of the film's humor. The action sequences, typical of Bay's directorial style, are fast-paced and explosive, keeping the audience engaged throughout.However, while the film is entertaining, it is not without its flaws. The plot is fairly predictable and follows a formulaic structure common to many action comedies of its time. Additionally, some of the humor and character dynamics feel dated by modern standards.Despite these shortcomings, \"Bad Boys\" delivers a fun and thrilling ride. Its blend of comedy, action, and star power makes it an enjoyable watch, particularly for fans of the genre. While not groundbreaking, it sets the stage for the successful franchise that follows.\n\n                    1 out of 1 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

                "Content": "Michael Bay's Bad Boys, his first feature film, is probably his best. But that sure isn't saying much. He has always favored the route of bloated and stupid rather than coherent and intelligent, and he is anything but subtle in his first feature attempt as a director. Consistent readers of my work know I have an incredible disdain for the director/writer himself, but I in no way believe he is a bad, horrible person. I'm just saying he writes, more often than not, bad, horrible films. I have no doubt in my mind that he is capable of writing and directing a good film, but he gets too involved with things that should be the secondary elements in a film. He brings background elements firmly into the foreground, and that poses a big problem.The story centers around Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Smith), two detectives for the Miami-Dade Police Department, who are called in to hunt down a $100 million worth of heroin that was intricately stolen from a secure vault. One of the petty criminals is Fouchet (Karyo), who early in the film shoots one of two escorts in his mansion. The other one named Julie (Leoni) will only speak to Lowrey on the count of her friends' relationship with the man.When Julie calls in about the murder, Lowrey is away, and the Captain forces Burnett to pose as Lowrey so as not to lose a valuable witness. He accepts, and off on a tangent we go through what is soon to be the long, eventful odyssey of mistaken identity. While Burnett puts Julie under protective custody, both the men work in seclusion to try and capture the drug lords and get their stash back.While not wonderfully executed, I can at least say that Bad Boys is fun and provides lightweight entertainment for those seeking it. It isn't the finest example of goofy, popcorn entertainment that I have encountered, but I can recognize the film has an audience that will be satisfied with the turnout, much like those horrifically awful Transformers films Bay so contently puts out. Just because I can respect that there is a fanbase for his material, doesn't mean I am forced to sit back and like it, and that's why I choose to voice my opinion on a lot of his films.Lawrence and Smith do a great job working together, both having expressive personalities and cheery, electric chemistry that provides kinetic energy to the screenplay. Although it appears as if their roles were switched. I have a hard time believing that Lawrence's Burnett is the mostly straight-laced cop with a family, and Smith's Lowrey is the fearless player with an act for taking advantage of women by having a different one every night. During the course of the film, I couldn't help but feel it should be the other way around. If that's a bit too vague to try and grasp, let me try and put it this way; has Will Smith ever been given a lesser role in any of his recent filmography? I too discovered that the original title for Bad Boys was going to be \"Bulletproof Hearts\" with SNL buds Dana Carvey and Jon Lovitz taking the roles of Lawrence and Smith. While I would've adored a buddy-cop comedy with Carvey and Lovitz as the leads, I couldn't quite grasp the idea of two cleaned-up guys like them playing dirty cops. For better or for worse, the roles were given to the right people.While the film provides light escapism, Bad Boys, however, makes one near-crucial mistake; it is too heavy-handed and over-produced to classify as campiness, which is what it is seemingly trying to achieve. It's a tad too long, shot like a music video (what else do you expect from Bay, who started out in that field?), and is viable because of its leads who have a charming chemistry and their commitment to a project so quirky and arbitrary. But, really, when you're working on a glossy piece of Hollywood, brought to you by someone whose talent is in the visual effects field and not much else, and are sometimes trudging through muddy clichés, whatcha gonna do? Starring: Martin Lawrence, Will Smith, Téa Leoni, and Tchéky Karyo. Directed by: Michael Bay.\n\n                    1 out of 1 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

For the most part, he annoys me and it seems like he has the same part in every movie, but I have to admit, I could tolerate him during this film.Marcus and Mike are two partner cops on the force together, they have been friends for a long time, Marcus is a married family man and Mike is still living up his one night stands. The boys are assigned to a missing dope case that turns into murder and helping the only witness, Julie, survive. Marcus takes the role as playing Mike to make sure that his family is safe, but you can guess how this story is going to turn out from here.Bad Boys was a pretty good buddy cop film, but it could have been funnier. Still, it was more original than most buddy cop films, considering that at least these bad boys had been friends for a long time. I would recommend Bad Boys for action movie lovers, it's worth a good watch, otherwise, it's an OK film for any average film fan.6/10\n\n                    3 out of 6 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

The success is attributable partly to the comedic talents of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence -- who have the ability to deliver crude, rude dialog such that it's funny nevertheless -- and partly to a story that combines suspense and humor into a believable whole. \nOur two heroes are police detectives Mike Lowry (Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Lawrence), who are a kind of tough-cop variation on The Odd Couple . Lowry is suave, slick, self-controlled, well-to-do, heroic, and a real ladies man.  Burnett, on the other hand, is an ordinary guy who manages to stumble reasonably effectively, if somewhat ineptly, through his work and his married life.So imagine what happens when Burnett has to convince a key witness, Julie (Téa Leoni) that he's Mike Lowry -- not just for a few hours, but for a few days.  Furthermore, this is no pre-planned, well-orchestrated masquerade.  A large stash of confiscated heroin has been un-confiscated right from police headquarters, and both the heroin and the perpetrator must be found within four days, or Internal Affairs is going to take some big-time disciplinary action.  Lowry and Burnett are called in because they were the ones who captured the heroin in the first place, and because of the one trait they share -- a renegade approach to police work, which may not have their boss's approval, but which does get the job done (and at one point, causes a store owner to think they're out to rob him).  The various twists and turns of the investigation lead to Lowry getting knocked out of commission at the same time that Julie witnesses a murder and refuses to deal with anybody but Mike Lowry.  But Marcus Burnett is the only one available to deal with her, and since waiting for Lowry to recover isn't an option  Subsequent events include Lowry's bachelor pad being invaded by Julie and her dogs, while Lowry stays with Burnett's wife, Burnett trying to keep his wife from finding out what's really going on, and Burnett and Lowry trying to find the heroin and keep Julie alive. For all you action movie fans, plenty of cars, plenty of buildings, and plenty of people get blown up along the way.  (Looking over this review, I see that I've belied the high level of violence, which I definitely should warn you against.)BAD BOYS kept me both amused and on the edge of my seat throughout.  I'm afraid I did have two small complaints, however.  First, I wish the resolution of the Burnett-pretending-to-be-Lowry  story had been timed to coincide with the resolution of the main plot. As it is, the comic subplot ends, leaving the rest of the movie to proceed in a rather formulaic and pedantic fashion.  Second, I wish more time had been spent on Lowry's problem of stepping into Burnett's shoes.  The swinging bachelor having to play family man would have been good for a few laughs that we never got.Aside from that, however, this is an action movie that stands out among the rest.One final note concerning the DVD \"Special Edition\" release.  BAD BOYS was a movie in which the music was particularly effective, and the DVD actually lets you listen to the music track by itself.  I wish DVDs of other movies with great music had this option.* Three examples that come to mind are 48 HOURS, KINDERGARTEN COP, and another Michael Bay film, ARMAGEDDON.  48 HOURS was grim enough to seriously stifle the humor, even with Eddie Murphy in the lead role.  KINDERGARTEN COP made me laugh, but the crime drama felt like an unwelcome intrusion. In ARMAGEDDON, I felt the stakes were high enough that humor didn't seem appropriate.\n\n                    23 out of 40 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?
