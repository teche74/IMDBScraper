O. S. Or Save our Seas saying the group have located Lillith\'s tracker in the Seine with incidents such as a driver crashing into the Seine and the body not being recovered. Initially skeptical, Sophia\'s fears are soon confirmed as circumstances soon see her team with Adil (Nassim Lyes) of the French police\'s River Brigade to try to handle the situation while dealing with potentially life threatening interference from both S. O. S. As well as the publicity and money hungry Mayor of Paris (Anne Marivin) who is hosting a triathlon in the Seine.Under Paris is the latest Netflix release and comes to us via versatile genre director Xavier Gens. The movie is another entry in the well tapped well of the subgenre of Shark movies that ever since the release of Jaws have come to acknowledge that bar will never be set with some opting for character studies, some using the format as an excuse for cheapness, while others go to the extreme of over the top excess (see examples of Deep Blue Sea and The Meg films). With Under Paris or Sous la Seine we definitely have an example of over the top excess and it\'s the best kind of ridiculousness that I\'ll admit I\'m a sucker for.While the movie has an environmental subtext in discussing real world issues like climate change and the Pacific Garbage Patch, that\'s honestly pretty secondary so this is less An Inconvenient Truth and more The Day After Tomorrow if the villain were sharks instead of global warming. From the opening slaughter at the garbage patch that cuts loose with the blood and gore in a rather refreshing fashion (even if I\'ll admit I could\'ve gone for some more practical work intermixed with what we have) Under Paris delivers the intensity and excess you\'d expect from a movie like this and it unapologetically dives in and goes for it. The acting from our leads of Berenice Bejo and Nassime Lyes is good and I give the actors props for treating this material as seriously as they would a procedural like Spiral. Anne Marivin serves as our secondary antagonist as a greedy mayor a la Jaws who isn\'t even trying to be subtle from her introduction that has her gesticulating over a scale model of Paris illustrating her big plans for the triathlon. And last but not least we have the shark itself Lillith, while the effects to bring the shark aren\'t top of the line (it\'s a modestly budgeted French film), what the producers lack in finer detail and rendering power they more than make up for with creativity and spirit. While they could\'ve stopped with the idea of ""shark in the Seine"" and that would\'ve been plenty to sell the movie, they go several steps beyond and the revelations about the shark not only have (sometimes literal) Earth shattering effect, but become borderline apocalyptic.I\'ll admit it\'s difficult to objectively review a movie like Under Paris because you can find no shortage of logical and scientific leaps that it takes, but it\'s that all too rare B-movie that could that commits to a bonkers high concept premise without feeling the need to wink at the camera and let the audience know it\'s in on the joke. It has scares that work, the action\'s exhilarating, and it\'s just fun. Sometimes all you need is fun escapist nonsense and you\'ll find that here I assure you.\n\n                    17 out of 33 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

On the surface, it\'s one of the most locked-in mid-90\'s nostalgia pieces I\'ve ingested, but beneath that it\'s one of the most complex coming-of-age films I can think of.To me, the movie was an expression of the kids who grew up in dysfunctional families in the 90\'s (the TV generation), those who were drawn to dark media due to that (which was extremely prevalent in the late 80\'s up through the mid 90\'s), and in turn, those who ended up with a far deeper connection with those dark fantasy worlds than they had with most other humans, and reality as a whole. When it\'s time to grow up, things get rough...I can relate, because I was 100% one of those kids during that exact era, so this one hit a lot of buttons that made a lot of sense for me.There are some impressively unique horror/monster effects in this film, that are equal parts comical and terrifying, simultaneously, which feels like yet another element that is heavily loyal to the era it is inspired by. This, along with many other elements, allow this movie to differentiate itself pretty boldly from everything else coming out right now. Common horror fans will likely just be confused by this film, which tends to be the case with most psychological horror films that actually offer anything with emotional purpose, but it offers plenty of cerebral scares and lots of melancholic gloom.Leads Brigette Lundy-Paine and Justice Smith do an immense job of keeping things deathly serious and dreamlike, Smith almost feeling like he fittingly ""can\'t handle being human"" a lot of the time. There are several sequences where their performances bring the movie to a full Lynchian realm - of course this is also due to visionary director Jane Schoenbrun\'s skilled directing. Speaking of that, I just realized that the segment that feels most like a nod to Lynch in a multitude of ways is the one that features bands performing live at a strange club, much like the Road House in the last season of Twin Peaks. Kris Esfandiari of King Woman makes an especially strong appearance here. It certainly doesn\'t hurt that they put together a very tasteful soundtrack that feels very reminiscent of the classic movie soundtracks of the 90\'s. It\'s fitting that the movie and soundtrack begin with a Broken Social Scene cover, because the whole album kind of feels like a full Broken Social\nScene album, with similar dynamics and vibes throughout.While it\'s truly hard to compare this to anything, it feels HIGHLY inspired by ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE DARK?, the Canadian kids horror program broadcast in the 90\'s on Nickelodeon, more than anything, while it\'s themes remind me only of a couple other movies, Pixar\'s INSIDE OUT, and the very wild SYNECDOCHE, NEW YORK. While I cried my eyes out at that Pixar movie, this one is too committed to its surrealism and gloom to induce actual tears, but the overall melancholy remains very heavy and very real throughout.This is a movie about the weirdos who found solace in media for weirdos. Brilliantly, the movie itself is weird (and sincere) enough to be that exact sort of weird type of media that the new young weirdos may find the same kind of solace in when they watch this as a teenager in reality now. I think that might be the whole point. If it wasn\'t, then it\'s awfully masterful accident. That\'s 2 strikingly unique and effective psychological horror films by Jane Schoenbrun now, 2 for 2...I officially deem thee a visionary force to be reckoned with.\n\n                    101 out of 200 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

It\'s obviously a ""love it"" for me, as I found the film moving and near-perfect on every level.If anyone\'s feeling hesitant because of Schoenbrun\'s micro-budgeted directorial debut, ""We\'re All Going to the World\'s Fair,"" ""TV Glow"" is completely different stylistically and in its scope. I appreciated ""World\'s Fair"" as a directorial debut and thought it had strong moments, but it ultimately fell short for me. HOWEVER, watching it did make me excited to see what Schoenbrun would do for their next film!While ""World\'s Fair"" felt mostly grounded in reality (or maybe a somewhat augmented reality due to the character\'s downward descent into their online world), the uncanny and hypnotic are more present in ""TV Glow."" As I mentioned, this isn\'t a straight-forward, in-your-face horror movie - it dabbles more in the Lynchian approach of slow-burn nightmares that leave you unsure of what exactly you just witnessed. The focus, though, is mostly on our protagonists and their individual and shared journeys of loneliness, dysmorphia, and the horrors that spawn from such damaging states of mind.Also, I can confirm (without spoilers) that this is NOT based on that one creepypasta about the mysterious children\'s TV show, ""Candle Cove""! The movie does center on a TV show for young people, but the type of show it is and its role in the characters\' lives are much different. While that creepypasta has a great and terrifying twist, this movie\'s characters\' relationship with ""The Pink Opaque"" is one of obsession, nostalgia, and realization.Lastly, ""TV Glow"" will likely PISS OFF viewers that cry ""WOKE"" at every instance of diversity or inclusion - and that is ALWAYS a PLUS in my book! What they\'re really complaining about is the fact that different people and communities are having more and more movies about them. I know, this review kind of went off track... the only thing left to say is: They\'ll be fine with ""The Beekeeper"", ""Argylle"", ""Fall Guy"", ""Boy Kills World"", and a slew of other Hollywood movies representing them in 2024 and beyond.

Jane Schoenbrun's genius--besides a couple excellent transitions--is that she achieves art by producing questions, not answers.The principal actors (including the boy who depicts the main character as a pre-teen) have to be commended, as it's got to be exceedingly difficult to act autism, or more to the point to depict a character who's emotionally distanced themself from reality due to the mental torture of being unable to express their authentic self. There are plenty of shining moments, and Brigette Lundy-Paine in particular achieves an enigmatic performance that will be worth returning to for cinephiles for the rest of time.

There\'s an ice cream and ice cream truck segment that is cinematic gold. Mr. Melancholy is a phenomenal character, and his ""man in the moon"" shots cracked me up. The father\'s discovery at the television was also incredible. The evolution of the characters and circumstances keeps you on edge until the final scene, leaving you feeling empty inside but impressed by the artistry of the film.In conclusion, I Saw the TV Glow is a unique and creative cinematic gem that is an absolute must-see. I would score it an 8/10 and strongly recommend it.\n\n                    20 out of 93 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

But my biggest gripe was that it wasn't a horror movie. It's a moody and bit spooky sometimes, and some parts that gave me full body chills. The moments of sadness and desperation were very moving. But no payoff on the horror front.That aside, I really enjoyed it. It was like Beau Is Afraid meets Twin Peaks season 3 meets Brigsby Bear meets Us, to name a few. The influences are obvious, but it still was a good film on its own.This movie has very relatable themes. Those who aren't LGBTQIA+ such as myself can still identify with the coming of age troubles, among others. I found myself discovering old feelings and memories, and identifying with the lead character strongly. And it offered me a glimpse into a wholly new perspective as well.It's a good movie, and I'm glad I was able to watch it in theaters. It's a step above an indie movie, but it's far from a masterpiece. It's visually stunning and goes deep.

I Saw the TV Glow takes the theme of using fantasy to forget about your troubles and catapults it to an extreme. The two main characters, Owen and Maddie, spend their teen years watching a Buffy the Vampire Slayer like show called The Pink Opaque. Both of them are loners, and in my opinion, autistic characters that have trouble with their parents, and classmates.After several years, and seasons of the show, Maddie runs away coincidentally after the series finale of their show, leaving Owen to maneuver through life with extreme anxiety and solitude. His mother died of cancer early in the film, and his father was distant and lacking of understanding of his son's inability to cope.I won't spoil what happens next, but it causes you to think. What if what you perceive as reality is but a myth? What if the fantasy that you use to escape is more than fantasy? What if you feel suffocated from depression that changing realities is your only way to survive?I often write about my struggles with mental illness, and my love of seeing it in mainstream media being treated with respect. This film goes above and beyond respecting people's conditions, and going to the aforementioned extreme of a person's inability to work with it, or have a support system. Go see this movie. As the POV happens from a character with mental illness, it shows a different side of the disease. A lot of films feature other characters helping out, but what if there was no one to help but yourself? Perception becomes reality, and reality can be not something that can be dealt with. This gets scary, and knowing how people feel can be all the difference.\n\n                    18 out of 87 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

I was correct. ""We\'re all going to the worlds fair"" was unlike any movie I\'d ever seen and came at the ""horror"" genre in such a unique way and one I had never seen before.

I went to the theater, sat down and was completely mesmerized from the first frame to the last. I seriously don\'t know if I ever even blinked..

Parts of my mind where I was like ""how tf did I forget this feeling"".. I can\'t even describe this film watching experience but the closest I can get is ""David Lynch on Nostalgic Steroids"" it\'s THE fever dream of all Fever Dreams. I could go on for paragraphs about the groundbreaking and nuanced acting performances, otherworldly cinematography and right on the money soundtrack ""that I can\'t stop listening to.."" but for now I\'m going to leave this review at how the movie made me feel and oh my god I haven\'t felt this much in so long and I\'m sincerely terrified I\'m going to start coughing up blue dirt any minute now..

To call it profound would be underselling it. It\'s been a long time since a movie struck a chord with me this instantly, spoke to me this deeply, to the point where I wanted to watch it again almost immediately after finishing it. I haven\'t stopped thinking about it since.I loved everything about this film: the story, the characters, the music, the directing, the cinematography, the color grading, the pacing, how large swaths of the runtime are allowed to just breathe and revel in the silence and give equal weight to everything said through the performances, as well as everything not said. It\'s an incredible love letter to the 90s and a very specific era of television, as well as the pain of growing up, feeling uncomfortable in one\'s own skin, and grappling with the loneliness, hopelessness, existential horror/dread, and lack of understanding or empathy inherent to the world around us. It\'s an incredibly moving, beautiful trans allegory, but also a statement about how numb and lost millennials feel in a reality they were promised would take care of them and instead has offered nothing but sadness, alienation, and disappointment after crushing disappointment. It\'s no wonder the characters (and the demographic of real people they represent) feel as if escapism is their only respite, the only avenue in which things make sense and the world isn\'t cruel.It\'s rare I come across a film I would describe as Important with a capital I, and this one is absolutely worthy of that designation. It is at once mesmerizing, haunting, hopeful, bleak, and like any great film with this many layers of meaning, open to interpretation. Different viewers will take different things away from this film\'s story and message. It can be enjoyed purely on an aesthetic surface level, or plumbed for hours regarding its subtext. I can\'t wait to watch it again and continue picking apart (in the best way) its every facet.True to the film\'s final message (not a spoiler), ""there\'s still time"". As long as you are alive, there is always still time to be who you might\'ve been. To be who you want to be. To strive towards happiness.Instantly barrels its way into my top ten of the year, and a strong contender for one of the top ten movies I\'ve seen in several years, maybe even longer. I can\'t recommend it highly enough.P. S. Also easily stands alongside other films like Drive and Mandy as having some of the most immaculate vibes I\'ve ever felt/witnessed in a movie.

I\'ve recommended it to a lot of fellow horror readers, too. I personally feel that the film adaptation falls incredibly short of what it could have been. The novel is beautifully crafted with suspense and character development, whereas the movie offers 2D characters that are simply there just because. Their faces remain blank the majority of the movie and their line delivery is flat and almost always as if they\'re bored talking.In true Shyamalan fashion, (yes, it\'s M. Night\'s daughter who directed it, but the apple doesn\'t fall far from the tree), the twist is a huge moment. While it does get revealed, it also changes a huge part of the original ending of the book, which makes the overall story even more of a 2D ""horror twist."" The book\'s ending gave me chills; the movie\'s ending gave me cliché horror.I will say, I was eager to see who would play the character of Madeline, as she is such a force in the book as the most interesting character, as well as the one who has been trapped in the forest the longest, and Olwen Fouéré portrays her beautifully. The overall set design and atmosphere of the film is also done well, which helps but also makes the movie\'s poor script and characters feel all the more disappointing at times.While I won\'t actively encourage not seeing this movie, I DO encourage you to check out the book, by A. M. Shine. I\'m also happy that an author whose work I appreciate it getting the attention of Hollywood to have his work made into a different media form - let\'s hope if his other works become film or television adaptations, that they\'ll be given the adaptation they deserve.\n\n                    46 out of 56 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Horror movies that involve a twist on folk stories accompanied with an eerie location usually pair well together and in this case, it does.Ishana Night Shyamalan\'s directorial debut is one to be proud of. You can clearly see sprinkles of her father\'s style imbedded in the film but also boasts her own unique vision.In regards to the plot, the story is interesting enough to keep you invested throughout the duration. It reveals just enough to ask questions but not enough to give them away.The design of the ""Watchers"" is the highlight of the film. Without spoiling too much, every time they were on screen I was fully engrossed. Enough was shown of them that made me wanting to see more.The worst unfortunately, are the characters which were one dimensional and lacking realism. They acted in ways no human would in this situation, especially the lead. A good horror movie requires realistic and likeable characters to vouch for. ""The Watchers"" struggled to create such.As most horrors unfortunately do, ""The Watchers"" does have some moments that I found a bit silly. Moments where you ask yourself ""why would she do that"" or ""why did that happen like that"". Such moments didn\'t help the film.I was skeptical towards the beginning on the film, thinking that it would meander in its plot and ultimately be repetitive. However, as the film progressed and its locations changed it kept the story fresh and wanting more. The ending boarded on lacklustre however, I didn\'t mind that it didn\'t get too ridiculous and over the top. Felt more realistic and poignant.Overall, a decent debut film that highlighted a fresh look at folk-lore.

Night's movies but in particular The Watchers reminded me a lot of The Village and the issues I have with that film and I think I'd still feel that way with or without the familial connection.Because like The Village, The Watchers has a very intriguing hook that presents a lot of interesting story possibilities very early on but it never capitalises on them in any satisfying way. The dialogue is really weak here and it's frequently delivered in extremely wooden ways which most rears its head in the exposition. Because Shyamalan clearly doesn't believe in the less-is-more approach in that she feels the need to over explain everything and as a result the mystery never really feels that intriguing. Most of the reveals come across as very flat that feel like they lack sufficient build up to be satisfying.It's also very repetitive for most of the first 2 acts with it essentially following the same stricture of leaving this house and returning to it before night fall and it just came across as tiring rather tension-building. The reveals don't really feel earned and they're the one thing I wanted the film to explore more but the script really feels like it strikes the worst balance with what it chooses to focus on. The 3rd act was also a pretty big disappointment. The main action that's being built up for the entire film is achieved in a fairly standard way that doesn't feel fitting for what was being set up and it makes the mistake of feeling like it's getting ready to end only to go on for what felt like another 30 minutes.Thankfully what saves the film from being a complete waste of time is the truly impressive filmmaking on display. It's gorgeously shot and visually ambitious in a way that feels like it could only come from a first-time director. I thought the score was phenomenal as was the cinematography in a way that didn't feel like it was drawing too much attention to itself. There are some very effective scares and genuine scenes of tension, unfortunately it was just never sustained enough to keep my interest. It's the script that ultimately sunk this movie for me but it's very clear that Ishana Night Shyamalan has real talent behind the camera.The Watchers was frustrating waste of potential for me and something that never really felt like it capitalised on its intriguing set up. It's just reeks of a script that doesn't trust the intelligence of it's audience and I was just so consistently irritated at how the film kept going out of it's way to explain things in the most clunky and unimaginative ways possible. I can see what Shyamalan was going for, and if anything it makes more interested to read the novel, but her very clear talents just end up being wasted on a really poor script.\n\n                    24 out of 35 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Night Shyamalan, steps into the spotlight with her debut film, The Watchers, a suspenseful horror film that's equal parts intriguing and frustrating. Mina (played with quiet intensity by Dakota Fanning), a young artist on a solo trip in Ireland, finds herself stranded in a remote forest with no way out. Seeking refuge, she stumbles upon a concrete bunker where three strangers are already holed up. But safety is a fleeting concept here. As night falls, a mysterious force emerges, forcing the group to huddle behind a large, one-way window-the only barrier between them and the unseen watchers.The film's greatest strength lies in its initial setup. The dense, uncharted forest evokes a sense of primal unease, and the concept of unseen entities lurking just beyond the window is undeniably creepy. Shyamalan keeps the creatures shrouded in shadow for a good portion of the film, relying on suggestion and flickering lights to build tension. This approach is reminiscent of classic monster movies like Alien or Jaws, where the unseen threat is often more terrifying than a fully revealed one.However, The Watchers struggles to maintain its momentum. The plot unfolds slowly, with long stretches of dialogue that do little to develop the characters beyond their basic survival instincts. While Fanning delivers a compelling performance, the supporting cast feels underdeveloped. The film throws in a childhood trauma element for Mina, but it feels tacked on rather than organically woven into the narrative.Visually, the film is a mixed bag. The use of colour is particularly interesting. The stark contrast between the warm, artificial light inside the bunker and the cold, oppressive darkness of the forest effectively creates a sense of isolation and vulnerability. However, some of the CGI effects used for the creatures later in the film feel a bit clunky and detract from the overall atmosphere. The editing is efficient, with jump scares used sparingly and to good effect.The film's ending, a signature Shyamalan twist, is sure to spark discussion. But unlike some of her father's more successful works, it doesn't quite land here. It feels more like a desperate attempt to inject a jolt of surprise rather than a satisfying conclusion to the established themes.The Watchers is a promising debut from Ishana Night Shyamalan. It showcases a clear understanding of suspense-building and a willingness to experiment with genre tropes. But, the underdeveloped characters, a slow pace, and a somewhat underwhelming twist hold the film back from reaching its full potential. If you're a fan of slow-burn horror with a dose of mystery, this might be worth a watch. But if you're expecting a truly terrifying experience, you might want to look elsewhere. It's an intriguing film with a great central premise, but its execution is uneven.\n\n                    21 out of 40 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Somebody's Watching Me!"", 'Content': 'LIKES:The SettingThe Camera WorkThe ActingThe Character Story To A DegreeThe GraphicsThe WritingThe BirdThe Overall Story Is OkaySUMMARY:\nThe Watchers is a movie that for the most part relies heavily on the imagination and the isolation effect to do the lifting of the movie. Under the guidance of Ishana, I found this movie successful in accomplishing this goal with camera work that finds optimum angles to convey the emotion of isolation. A fantastic setting of the grey European forest alongside dynamic lighting and special effects draws out a dismal and isolated feeling that leaves one feeling hopeless at times given the desolate world. As the world continues to reveal itself and the Watchers begin to emerge, the graphics continue to look decent, with smooth and horrific animation, some awesome details in the skin texture, and some haunting movements that further rip away the comfort and elicit the horror element. Sound editing that accompanies it further immerses you into the doomed forest, done well to optimize the terror and try to set you up for the jump scares they were shooting for.In regards to the story to which the scares are built from, it\'s okay. Another symbolic and artistic approach, The Watchers\' story relies heavily on some folklore for adaptation, something that does not show up until the second half of the film, and that revelation is both a bit more original and lackluster at the same time. A gradual revelation shows a bit more merit helps escalate how far this tale goes, and assists with helping draw out the horror and help fill in some of the story gaps. The character stories flesh things out a bit more, each of the four ""heroes"" holding some light and depth that hold some realistic relatability to care for the characters stuck in this mess. This movie holds heavy dialogue and the writing is smart at times and engaging, with heavy words, engaging delivery, and a strong atmospheric tone to establish the rules. I found the words brought to life well by most of the acting in the limited cast of this film. Fanning is about the same as always, listless, and creepy, and can portray the more somber emotions better than most as she faces the horrors of her past and present. Campbell offers more variety, bringing a bit of light into the movie that helps cut through the monotone depression and keep things engaging, especially during some of the trials forced upon her. Fouere is articulate and creepy in her role, all of her words so heavy, deep, and accented that they bring gravity to help enhance the story elements and somehow make the unknown more uncomfortable. Oliver Finnegan as well plays his role well, adding that unbalanced nature that adds a bit more of that psychological component to the film, further keeping the teeter-totter swaying back and forth Add in a cute bird that does very little and yet so much to help contrast the tone of the movie, and you round out the movie\'s likes for me.DISLIKES:The Plot\'s EndingMore Character Story NeededThe Revelation is DisappointingThe Twist Was PredictableMore Danger and Suspense NeededSome Odd Plot GapsA Bit More Emotional Components To the CharactersSUMMARY:\nDespite all the elements that were engaging, The Watchers has issues with some of the usual nuances this movie genre suffers from. In the story department, the plot\'s ending is a bit of a letdown for me, not because of the content that they chose, but because the execution is mediocre and rushed at times. Perhaps we needed more gradual discovery in the woods, more time spent in the danger field, and a few moments edited to be earlier in the film. The characters needed more depth as well, helping to give them more layers like they tried to give Fanning\'s character and helping give me more to either root for or against. The editing might have helped with smoothing out plot gaps and questions that distracted me during the time. They do answer some of the questions, but there are still some unresolved or a stretch. And the twist that came was predictable for many reasons, and thus the revelation was mediocre for me as well. Perhaps the biggest thing needed though, is more terror and close calls. The Watchers is missing so much of that, with the climactic components very mundane because there was so much more they could do. After such an epic setup with the environment and camera work, the lack of real challenges and trials was a very disappointing finish for horror fans who like a little more bite to their thriller.The VERDICT\nAnother movie of mundane horror, The Watchers has elements that the Shyamalan tribe knows how to do well in their movie media. Fantastic visuals, audio, and dialogue are the centerpieces of this film, with good characters and acting to a degree to bring it to life. It blends folklore and scares in a nice hybrid with some emotional depth beyond the typical horror movie. A smarter approach to conveying terror, returning to your imagination being the primary painter, it works so hard to play off of the fears of isolation, desolation, and hopelessness that made me feel more uncomfortable than the bad guys themselves. Where the movie fails is the pacing of the plot, spreading out that allure and explanation to give the film more bite, alongside needing more time and writing to the characters to build them up past the solemn humans we get. In addition, more scares, close calls, and strategy needed to be executed so that we might have a bit more excitement in suspense in their attempts to get out of the forest.

Night Shyamalan; I doubt the film would have ever been made if daddy hadn't produced it. The script is absolutely terrible, full of flaws and lapses of logic.Dakota Fanning plays Mina, who becomes lost in a strange forest where she finds shelter in a glass-fronted building occupied by three other people; there, she is informed that she and her new acquaintances are exhibits, to be gawped at during the night by creatures that live underground during the day.Here are just some of the things that annoyed me about the film...When Mina found herself driving down a dirt track that clearly wasn't going anywhere, why didn't she turn around and try to find a new route?What did the people in 'the coop' use for toilet paper?How did they keep themselves clean with no washing facilities? Did they wear the same underwear every day?Did they have plates and cutlery?If Daniel had been there for eight months, how did he keep his hair so short?Where did they all sleep? There was only one bed. And when did they sleep? During the night, when the watchers were spying on them? I thought they had to keep the watchers entertained during the night...Where did Daniel get the huge length of cable needed to connect the camera to the television? And are we expected to believe that the camera came with still functioning batteries?Where did Daniel and Mina get that long length of rope from?If it's possible to successfully hide from the watchers under some branches, why not build such hideouts beyond the points of no return, thus making escape more likely?Who was keeping the generator topped up with fuel? Did no-one question where the power source was hidden?Would a university really leave a professor's room untouched for over thirty years?And as for the building of 'the coop', this made no sense whatsoever. Where did the professor live while it was being built? How did he leave the forest to find more construction workers? Did no-one become suspicious about all of the missing builders? And why did he have the coop fitted with a massive one-way mirror if he was going to spend most of his time in the bunker?The whole time I was watching the film, I was thinking to myself 'How could this get any worse?', and then it did.1/10.

But, it still manages to be a marginally better watch than ""Roohi."" Munjya is not the perfect horror comedy, but it brings something new to the table. A blend of horror and comedy is well supported by some effective CGI work that brings the ghostly elements to life.Directed by Aditya Sarpotdar, who is known for his impressive work in Marathi cinema, ""Munjya"" stands out with its unique script and engaging narrative. The film\'s story, while intriguing, is somewhat let down by its uneven execution. The first half has a few loose ends that might leave audiences scratching their heads, but the second half picks up the pace, delivering a captivating experience. Saurabh Goswami\'s cinematography successfully creates a spooky atmosphere that complements the film\'s tone. The background music score and VFX are other highlights.The cast of Munjya delivers commendable performances, despite the film\'s weaker star power compared to its genre counterparts. Abhay Verma shines as Bittu, convincingly portraying the character\'s fear. Sharvari impresses with her acting too. Sathyaraj, as the quirky godman, delivers an amusing performance, and Taranjot Singh provides many laughs as well. Mona Singh, though given limited screen time, is effortlessly impactful in her scenes. One of the film\'s highlights is its end-credit scene, following the Taras song.

Rest of the cast is okayishhh with little scope for their art . Munjya(CGI) himself is sometime a little irritating and it may be because of poor supporting acting skill by protagonist Mr. Abhay Verma, needs real improvement to sustain in bollywood .

Now, he needs to save his loved ones from Munjya, as the spirit has tagged along with him.The story is innovative and keeps you engaged. It takes all cinematic liberties, which is fine for such movies, but the lack of character development cannot be overlooked. The comedy in this universe has always been very organic to the narrative, but here it feels highly forced in many places.Abhay Verma, in the leading role, is the heart and soul of the movie. His innocent charm and balanced expressions are sure to win your heart. He is a good find and is here to stay. Sharvari Wagh has hardly anything to perform, and even in her limited screen time, she goes overboard. Her character is highly underdeveloped. Also, the chemistry between the leads is zero. Mona Singh, as the loud mother, is decent. The fun and comedy brought by Sathyaraj are the best parts of the movie. Every scene featuring him is a laughing riot, proving his acting chops yet again. Suhas Joshi as the grandmother is endearing and does well.The graphics and CGI work to create Munjya are amazing. The technical crew has done a commendable job with it. If the story had more depth, it could have worked wonders. The editing is shabby, to say the least, as the scenes jump from one to another haphazardly. The BGM has worked in its favor, maintaining the horror feel. The jump scares placed here and there are nice but do not genuinely scare, which is a letdown.This universe has had amazing songs in other movies, but it was a big disappointment here. The post-credit scene connecting Bhediya didn't add anything to the story and felt too forced.

The film starts with a quintessential haunted scenario: eerie noises, dark settings, and spine-chilling suspense. It almost perfectly sets up a classic horror movie atmosphere that grips the viewer with its intensity.As the story progresses, however, ""Munjya"" deftly shifts gears. What begins as a spine-chilling narrative slowly unravels into more of a mediocre haunted comedy, especially after revealing the CGI of Munjya. The initial horror setup, which showed high potential, gradually gives way to comedic elements that dominate the latter half of the film.While the transition from horror to comedy is seamless for some, it might disappoint viewers who were invested in the high-stakes terror of the first act. The film\'s shift in tone, especially marked by the less-than-impressive CGI of the titular Munjya, feels like a letdown. The creature that once seemed menacing becomes a source of slapstick humor, diluting the initial impact of the horror.The performances are commendable, with the cast showcasing impressive versatility. Their reactions to the absurdity of their situation feel genuine, and the comedic moments are well-timed. However, the screenplay\'s pivot to humor may not sit well with everyone, particularly those who were expecting a more consistent horror narrative.Technically, ""Munjya"" shines in its early stages with excellent cinematography and sound design that amplify the horror experience. The eerie visuals and creepy sound effects are executed with precision. However, as the film shifts to comedy, the visual gags and timing, while handled competently, might not be enough to satisfy the initial promise of a horror story.In conclusion, ""Munjya"" is a unique cinematic experience that blends horror and comedy. It starts strong with a high-potential horror story but gradually turns into a comedy. This shift might delight some but could be disappointing for those who hoped for a sustained horror experience. It\'s a rollercoaster ride that begins with scares but ends with laughs, making it a mixed bag depending on your genre preference.\n\n                    0 out of 0 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Each visit to the tree lacks the dramatic or comedic impact that the filmmakers presumably intended, turning what could have been a source of suspense or humor into a repetitive and nonsensical gimmick.The script is one of the film\'s weakest aspects. Rather than exploring the protagonist\'s struggles in a meaningful way, it opts for a series of poorly constructed scenes that fail to engage or amuse. The protagonist\'s frequent crying and subsequent retreats to the cursed tree feel like a lazy plot device rather than a character-driven choice. There\'s a sense of aimlessness in his actions, and the lack of character development leaves the audience with little to root for.Comedy, which should have been a strength of the film, falls flat due to weak writing and ineffective delivery. The characters seem to try too hard to be funny, but their efforts come across as forced and awkward. The punchlines miss their mark, and the timing-so crucial for comedic effect-is consistently off. There is an evident struggle to balance the comedic and supernatural elements, but the execution feels amateurish, and the humor never quite lands.Moreover, the supporting characters, who are presumably meant to add comedic relief, come across as one-dimensional and foolish. Their interactions are often absurd without being amusing, and their contributions to the plot are negligible at best. This lack of engaging side characters further highlights the script\'s inadequacies. Their attempts at humor feel more like desperate ploys to elicit laughter, but they instead highlight the film\'s inability to deliver genuine comedic moments.The film\'s pacing exacerbates these issues, dragging through scenes that contribute little to the overall narrative. The story moves without direction, leading to a conclusion that is as unsatisfying as the journey itself. The climax fails to provide any resolution or growth for the protagonist, who remains disappointingly unchanged. This static characterization undermines any emotional investment the audience might have had, leaving them frustrated by the lack of character progression.Despite its potential, ""Munjya"" suffers from a fundamental disconnect between concept and execution. The idea of a cursed tree and a protagonist facing supernatural consequences for his woes could have been the foundation for a compelling narrative. Instead, it is squandered by lackluster writing and a protagonist who never rises above his initial, unimpressive state. This failure to capitalize on the story\'s inherent possibilities is the film\'s greatest disappointment.In summary, ""Munjya"" is a missed opportunity. Its promising premise is let down by a poorly constructed script, ineffective comedy, and a protagonist who remains a ""loser"" till the end. The film\'s inability to deliver on its comedic and supernatural potential results in a narrative that feels disjointed and uninspired. ""Munjya"" could have been an engaging blend of humor and horror, but it falls short, leaving audiences with little more than frustration and unfulfilled expectations. The movie\'s attempt to blend genres results in a muddled experience, making ""Munjya"" a forgettable entry in the realm of horror-comedies.\n\n                    2 out of 3 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Actually, I\'d like to forget that there were any horror universe movies after Stree (2018) and would love to directly see ""Stree 2"" as the second film if they really care about the ""standard."" Roohi didn\'t even fit in the universe zone; Bhediya was a shocking low for Amar Kaushik after Stree and Bala; and now, Munjya shows another low for the horror universe. What is a horror comedy, by the way? For today\'s audience, it\'s about mediocrities like Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2; for a certain group, it\'s Stree; for a little more mature group, it\'s Bhool Bhulaiyaa (2007)-if they couldn\'t really understand that pathbreaking impact of Manichitrathazhu; for higher-level movie buffs, it\'s Ghostbusters; and then comes the highest gallantry group of movie geniuses who love Gene Wilder\'s Frankenstein spoof or Abbott and Costello\'s horror spoofs or early breakthroughs like ""The Ghostbusters"" (1940) and ""The Cat and The Canary"" (1939) or the grandfather of all, James Whale\'s cult, ""The Old Dark House"" (1932). Those who acknowledged and ate all those films at weekend dinners can see how low Munjya is as a horror comedy. Today, horror is comedy. That\'s a statement to keep in mind. Horror and comedy are two different things and should be kept like that. If I try to shake them together, you are sure to spoil the juice. Munjya does that while trying to be overly funny and overly aggressive at the same time.According to folklore in Maharashtra\'s Konkan coast, Munjya (the Bramharakshas) is believed to be the ghost of unmarried boys who died within 15 days of the ""Mujya"" ceremony, inhabiting peepal trees. Munjyas are described as restless bachelor ghosts who roam trees at night, possessing cleverness and multilingual abilities. Our protagonist, Bittu (Abhay Verma), is living in Pune but is haunted by bad dreams of a tree and a Munjya that\'s bound to it. He loves Bela (Sharvari) but never dared to tell her, making the path clear for Bela\'s foreigner friend. During his recent visit to his native place and, by mistake, to the Chetukwadi (a place where Munjya resides), he frees Munjya from the tree. This Munjya happens to be one of his ancestors, who wanted to marry Munni but died before that. Now, he wants to marry Munni, and Bittu is forced to help him. His search for Munni ends with Bela, who happens to be Munni\'s blood relative. So now Bittu must save Bela from Munjya by finding a way to kill the Brahmarakshas.Munjya\'s script is scattered into pieces, and it\'s damn boring and predictable for today\'s audience. If Munjya was such a powerful ghost, then how can you show humans even trying to fight him like it was a college fight and having conversation as if he were their buddy? I can imagine a 15-year-old boy being too aggressive about marrying a girl and doing all that black magic stuff, but how can someone ask me to believe it\'s all done by a 10- or 12-year-old boy? Muniya\'s basic variant looked too underage to pull off the entire idea of the film. I couldn\'t figure out how Bittu found that beating stick after all in the climax. Wasn\'t it supposed to be lost with his dead grandmother? Firstly, he was a big-time fattu, and Munhya was a big-time goon, so the face-off wasn\'t really convincing. We all know that stuff about finding courage, finding our own strength, and all that. Many filmmakers have done that over a hundred times, including Sarpotdar himself in his own Faster Fene (2017) and Mauli (2018). Ok, so which mom goes on a trip with his son and his friends without any reason and at that place where she never wanted to come back? Those kiddish play games by Munjya at Bittu\'s house were so annoying. They just killed all the chances of me fearing evil. I was rather taking it as a spoof of Munjya and the terrible voiceover and characterization they have done here. Never for a moment, I thought that Munjya was going to scare me. Not even once.Speaking of performances, Sharvari did look promising with Bunty aur Babli 2 and The Forgotten Army, but here, she seemed to be going down. Bela\'s character was poorly written, and moreover, there was nothing for Sharvari to add to it. It was just like she came on sets, shot her scenes as the writer wrote them and the director directed them, went home, and slept well. No extra efforts, because there was no place for that. Abhay Verma didn\'t look like a protagonist at all. He was more like a scapegoat who can\'t do anything, yet he remains alive till the end. You know, Munjya could have killed him within 2 seconds. Character-wise, it was full, but acting-wise, it was pretty okay. Suhas Joshi still holds enough fire, and Mona Singh couldn\'t find her fire. Sathyaraj is made into a cartoon here, and it\'s highly disrespectful to his stature. I was kind of expecting a lot of Marathi actors since the film was set in Konkan and it was being directed by Aditya Sarpotdar. I was happy to see so many Marathi faces, but sadly, they all went overacting. Overall, I can say that Munjya has to be the weakest and least known casting unit in the horror universe.The music here is terribly disappointing. I still remember those hit songs from Stree. Roohi destroyed my childhood memories of Shamur, and Bhediya went away with a pretty good album. Compared to the previous films, Munjya has the weakest music album in the horror universe. The cinematography captured some beautiful shots of the Konkan coast and that remote island of Chetukwadi. Pune is easy to catch on camera, and it looked too intentional most of the time. Munjya\'s background score is painfully loud. A horror film can\'t go wrong with its BGM, but Munjya did. That\'s just not done. You can\'t F with this department-not even by mistake. The art design and production were partially fine, and the VFX was a mix of ugliness and gorgeousness. Sarpotdar\'s sasta Gollum is too poor to be considered a demon in a horror flick. But what to do when you have folklore telling you so? Still, I think the visual effects could have been much better and fancier. Munjya falls flat on both story and storytelling. Had these things been better, I wouldn\'t have minded much about the screenplay, background score, and acting. Lastly, I only want to ask one question to the makers: Bhai, taras nahin aaya audience pe? I hope, Stree 2 gives a new life to the dead horror universe now.RATING - 4/10*\n\n                    8 out of 21 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

You actually care about the characters.

I do feel like among certain fan circles the movie is slightly 'overhyped' but that doesn't make the movie bad, it is in fact quite good. I think the exploration of the main character's relationship with kamikaze piloting, and in turn both Japan's historical understanding of that phenomenon as well as the West's, is actually still more poignant and worth exploring than perhaps we might be inclined to give it credit for. It's hard to overstate how culturally significant the kamikaze pilots were during and in the immediate aftermath of World War 2; although we had Oppenheimer to remind us of the cultural impact of the bomb, for soldiers that lived during World War 2, it was the stories of the kamikaze pilots that left a huge impact, even for people not in the Pacific theater. Likewise, Japan has long struggled to articulate its historical relationship to kamikaze pilots, with the memorial there being a kind of hot-button issue for multiple decades now. This film perhaps doesn't offer a searing insight, but rather a kind of wishful alternate path to how Japan and the west feels about kamikaze pilots. I think what's particularly remarkable about this film, frankly, is the way it pushes against the grain--a lot of Japanese cinema, especially that designed for view by western audiences, tends toward a construction of victimhood due to the bomb. This film tries to grapple with the echoes of imperial desire both immediately after the war and, perhaps, now.Honestly, come for the big cool depiction of Godzilla, but leave with a reflection of Japan's relationship to World War 2.\n\n                    50 out of 65 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

I was intrigued, even though I\'ve never seen any of the classic Godzilla films. You won\'t regret seeing the film, but I didn\'t walk away feeling like I\'d just watched the film of the year either.Godzilla Minus One follows the story of a kamikaze pilot who aborts his mission and lands on a small supply island. Later, Godzilla emerges and wipes out nearly everyone. Haunted by his actions, both in failing to carry out his mission and failing to act in saving the others on the island, the pilot returns to Tokyo and attempts to rebuild his life. Before long though, Godzilla reemerges and he feels compelled to join the defense of Tokyo.It\'s a good story, and there\'s an endearing human element to it all. The movie\'s not short of political commentary either, whether in subtext or unambiguous comments from the characters, ranging from views of honor and duty, criticism of the government, or even Japan\'s diminished autonomy in light of defeat in WWII. Notice that no government really does anything in the movie. The U. S. is sidelined because of concerns over raising tensions with the Soviets; the Japanese government is unable to act. Instead, it\'s the people themselves who have to act and save themselves.Towards the end, the film veers harder and harder towards melodrama, which detracted from the nice balance of seriousness and humor that had been present throughout the first several acts. Maybe it\'s a terrific Godzilla film; I can\'t speak to that. (This reminds me of the 007 films. There are ""good"" Bond films that still aren\'t good movies.) I can say that this Godzilla is a good movie and worth your time.\n\n                    63 out of 87 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

It would look great in a modern Anime, or something where everything is in CGI, but not this.

Don't even get me started on the cartoonish looking Godzilla, with it's undersized head, googly eyes, and baby t-rex like arms. As if the CGI wasn't bad enough, the director decided to make Godzilla look like a joke on purpose as homage to the original, but it just made me unnerved to watch. It's not scary anymore because of this; the fear wasn't there for me because of the poorly executed cgi, lack of build-up to destruction scenes, or enough shots of Godzilla doing anything.I can't believe the same director thinks he's good enough to shoot a Star Wars movie because of the feedback he's getting from this movie.

When the trailer came out, I thought it was gonna be another dumb, incompetent mess.I was proved wrong.From the very start, everything from the directing, performances to the cinematography and sound design were absolute stunning. How a low budget managed this feat was beyond me but the film was simply mesmerizing to look at.The horror was quite effective with jumpscares and dreadful moments, albeit some cheap ones but not that distracting. They were able to build up the tension so well and never intended to tone it down right till the very end. The plot was simple enough to interlink all relevant characters to make me care about them, although some could complain 90% of the characters were just filler and I might agree with that. However, the protagonist was good enough to carry the whole show.One thing that may not sit well with a lot of audience was the use of mental illness. Smile handled it decently but don't expect Oscar worthy exposition. And no, it wasn't exactly the main theme so try not to quit halfway through because there would be surprises by the last act of the film.Give it a go. I'd say it was well worth the time for horror fans like myself. This was not just some Annabelle or Insidious sequels but something more.\n\n                    48 out of 58 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

One day, Laura, a young student, is brought in for observation. After witnessing the brutal suicide of her professor, she seems to be suffering from extreme post-traumatic stress disorder. As Rose talks to Laura, the girl gets increasingly frightened, claiming an unseen entity is about to kill her. Suddenly, she becomes calm, smiling unnaturally, before slitting her own throat. Afterwards, bizarre events convince Rose that the entity is now stalking her; and that she is its next victim.An unnerving horror, Parker Finn's 'Smile' is a creepy examination of the lingering effects of trauma. Finn's narrative contends that trauma effects every aspect of one's life, and can be passed onto others through one's actions. Although comparisons to David Robert Mitchell's 'It Follows' are inevitable, Parker's handling of the film's thesis feels fresh and innovative. Traumatic effects- such as hallucinations, paranoia and guilt- are interwoven cleverly into Finn's narrative, adding to the psychological horror therein.The film is suspenseful, having a heady atmosphere of dread throughout. Although the ending is underwhelming, the journey there is an engaging, sinister one. Finn makes excellent use of jump-scares- which often feel like a cheap way to make viewers jolt. They don't here, as they intensify the paranoid state Rose is in. His characterisation is strong, as is his dialogue, and we believe and sympathise with Rose; even if we're unsure whether or not we can trust her version of reality. Culturally relevant and unsettling, Finn's film makes for a wild and devilish ride.For a horror to be successful, good sound design is necessary; Finn's sound department have created an immersive and disquieting environment of terror. Cristobal Tapia de Veer's score adds to the discomforting atmosphere, becoming chaotically dissonant as Rose descends further into paranoid fear. Reminiscent at times of Dario Argento and Goblin's score for 'Suspiria,' Tapia de Veer's work enhances the film's impact immensely.Similarly, Charlie Sarroff's unconventional cinematography heightens the picture's uneasy ambiance. Distinct and creative, his utilisation of low angles, handheld shots and zooms fosters a sense of unpredictable instability. Under Finn's direction, his implementation of lighting creates contrast and mood, while his composition of images also adds to the film's horror. He uses symmetry, asymmetry and negative space to create imbalance, tension and emptiness; depending on the needs of the scene. Striking and memorable, Sarroff's work is captivatingly disturbing.Furthermore, Lester Cohen's minimalist production design creates a stark, cold world for Rose to navigate. Cohen uses simple, sparse sets and props to create a sense of realism, emptiness and isolation. Moreover, Alexis Forte's costume design adds to the film's horror, as her use of colours, fabrics and differing styles creates contrast, character and symbolism. Additionally, the picture is well edited by Elliot Greenberg, whose work gives 'Smile' a rapid, tense pace that vastly intensifies proceedings.Sosie Bacon stars as Rose, delivering an impassioned, nuanced performance, acutely showing Rose's psychological disintegration. Feverish and powerful, Bacon's work is not to be forgotten. Alongside her, Kyle Gallner plays Jake, a cop who is Rose's ex-boyfriend, and the only one who believes her story. A steady presence throughout, Gallner does fine work in a role lesser actors would have overplayed. Robin Weigert and Gillian Zinser- as Rose's psychiatrist and sister, respectively- both impress with their range and ability, while Caitlin Stasey is terrific in the all too small role of Laura; portraying her immense fear astutely.An entertaining, tense horror about the devastating effects of trauma, Parker Finn's directorial debut 'Smile' lingers in the mind long after the credits have rolled. Boasting an engaging narrative dealing maturely with its themes, an atmospheric score and striking production design, it is a riveting watch. Although the ending is anticlimactic, the compelling performances from the cast- especially Sosie Bacon- keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. Creepily captivating, this film will surely not leave you with a frown.\n\n                    32 out of 40 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

The real shocker here, is this was all put together buy an amateur filmmaker, Parker Finn, who wrote and directed this, his first feature film, based on one of his only two prior short films. So yeah, this near perfect gem is from an unexperienced newb filmmaker, and Finn has left his mark in this genre as the filmmaker to watch out for. Clearly, Sosie Bacon's spot-on performance helped seal the deal, but also note that her cast direction was from the same new inexperienced filmmaker.The pacing, albeit slow - which I'm not a fan of, actually worked perfectly in setting the film's tone.

I wasn\'t expecting some 11-time Oscar winning masterpiece, but I did expect an intense, edge-of-your-seat scarefest like that of \'Insidious\' or \'Sinister\', where the movie is dripping with creepy unsettlingness from start to finish. \'Smile\' is not that. What \'Smile\' does well is build up the jump scare, but unfortunately (and more importantly), \'Smile\' forgets to deliver the scare in each of these sequences it repeats throughout its way overlong 2-hour runtime.Example, the main character will be staring down a dark hallway while the music tenses and camera slowly zooms in, and then the phone will ring SO LOUD. This is NOT a scare! This is just lazy and, above all, annoying. These ""jump scares"" happen throughout the ENTIRE movie and are extremely obnoxious. I can respect jump scares if there\'s actually something scary at the end of the build-up, not just an obnoxiously loud noise that has nothing to do with the tension that was just wasted. An example of an ACTUAL jump scare would be like when the Lipstick Demon appears at the table for the first time in \'Insidious\'. THAT is a warranted jump scare.The plot of \'Smile\' and the way the characters unravel it is almost identical to \'The Ring\'. No new ground is broken, which was expected, but I at least expected a little more originality than a copy/paste story of \'The Ring\' with a good amount of \'It Follows\' copied as well, yet is far less than both those movies.What I thought was pretty good was the ending, when the demon finally reveals itself. The design of the demon and what it does to its victims is actually pretty great/gruesome. Unfortunately, by the time we\'re introduced to the Smile demon, the movie\'s over. Such a shame, as this movie could have been a balls-to-the-wall nail-biting chiller. The score for this movie was hands-down the best and creepiest part.

I guess that's the downside of having seen so many horror films -- not much seems very original or scary anymore.My rating: 6/10 (my wife gave it 8/10, so she must have enjoyed herself).\n\n                    23 out of 43 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

In the prologue an aged Father Harris (Charles Dance) is tracked down by Father Brennan (Ralph Ineson), Harris relates a garbled tale about a baby created through a woman mating with the Devil. The progeny is destined to be the mother of the Antichrist. Shortly afterwards Father Harris is showered by stained glass and a piece of scaffolding takes a chunk out of his head, obviously just happenstance. Rome, 1971, Margaret (Nell Tiger Free) arrives from the US to take her vows at a school/orphanage, herself an orphan, she was raised by the Roman Catholic Church. She is met by Cardinal Lawrence (Bill Nighy) who a decade before had counselled her when she was having troubles. They travel to the Convent to the background of Trade Union and Student protests; the Cardinal reflects on how the RCC is also losing the support of young people. These disturbances continue in the background over the radio until Margaret is caught up in a riot during a pivotal scene,The Convent seems to be a happy place, the children are treated well, they have parties, nuns bounce on trampolines, even the elder sisters smoke and crack jokes. However Margaret finds that one child Carlita (Nicole Sorace) is often kept in a room, tied to a bed even. Carlita acts up, is violent, draws strange pictures, Margaret realises that Carlita is acting like she did years ago, so she bonds with her. Similar to Immaculate there is a naughty novitiate, Luz (Maria Caballero) she browbeats Carlita into going dancing and drinking, after all one must live before leaving secular life. Things take an odd turn at the orphanage, Carlita has terrifying visions, a strange young nun, Angelica connects with both Margarey and Carlita. Father Brennan reappears and tries to convince Margaret that a conspiracy is at play to create the Antichrist. The plot now takes an interesting turn which it would be a spoiler to reveal.The First Omen is a largely satisfying film in its own right and promises to take the franchise off at an angle to the previous films. There are scenes of graphic horror, not least in the birth scenes where elements of body horror are introduced along with Margaret's visions of the risen dead. Some good jump scares but the pacing of the film takes away from the effect of a couple of these. A tightening up of the convent scenes with additional exposition of Margaret's backstory might have improved the flow of the narrative. Nell Tiger Free's part demands a lot and she is equal to it as her character develops. Maria Caballero is wonderful in her nunsploitation role in the nightclub scenes and in her dress sense, this sequence and her later taking of vows introduces a touch of Dario Argento. Nicole Sorace gives a fine performance as the disturbed and conflicted young girl.. Bill Nighy gives further support as the enigmatic and pragmatic Cardinal. Of course The First Omen introduces a few characters who featured in the 1976 film The Omen and even pays homage to several of its gory death scenes (improving on at least one of those).

It's also remarkably similar to 'Immaculate (2024)', to the point that one would seem to have ripped off the other if it had been released significantly later (the tiny gap between the two films' release dates indicates a case of parallel thinking, rather than plagiarism). Its most valuable asset is its direction, which makes use of assured cinematography and measured pacing to deliver some really well-achieved sequences that are typically as unsettling as they are atmospheric. The picture is often dripping with dread, evoking this intangible sense that what you're seeing is actually evil. With an unrelentingly ominous soundtrack, some really confronting imagery and the overall texture - both aesthetic and narrative - of something straight out of the seventies, the film carves its own unholy mark on the genre and is often really compelling (even during its more obviously silly moments). Its pacing does wane slightly in its second act, and its central mystery - or, at least, where it's heading - is unfortunately really obvious if you've seen 'The Omen (1976)' (or even read the tagline). I guessed the movie's major twist within the first few moments, for instance, and being ahead of the narrative doesn't do the experience any favours considering its enigma is pretty much its main driving force. Even if you aren't able to see the reveal coming, the film's main problem still has a strong impact. The issue is that it has to tie in to the original, which severely diminishes the potential - and power - of its third act. The finale just feels incredibly boxed in, and it doesn't help that the flick isn't content to just strongly imply. Instead, it feels the need to spell out, with a rushed epilogue that ends on a namedrop that's intended to carry weight but actually just feels weird. It's not as if the rest of the movie is exactly subtle, but the climax feels like a total sledgehammer in the worst possible way (not in terms of its in-universe implications, but its meta ones). It's bending to the studio's idea of what it needs to be, rather than what it it's been naturally building towards. However, this obviously top-level interference isn't enough to significantly reduce the overall effectiveness of the affair. It's still a really accomplished in-the-moment experience, despite its legitimate narrative issues. The direction really is rock-solid, as are most of the performances, and there's a palpable sense of foreboding throughout. A lot of the set-pieces are rather unsettling, too. It's ultimately a strong effort that suffers most from being part of a wider franchise, yet is also far better than you may expect an entry in said franchise to be.

Rosemary's baby, for several reasons, is my most hated horror movieWhat we have here is a good take on Rosemary's baby.Let me explain without spoilers why this isn't an Omen movie. The signature of the Omen franchise is that the deaths occur with a Rube Goldberg clockwork precision (later incorporated in the Final Destination films) coupled with an Alan Silvestri soundtrack that conveyed intent and malice. In short, it was clear that Satan was watching over his son. There were also cumbersome rules about how a mortal could kill the antichrist, all making for great tension.The preview for this film hinted at this with scenes filmed in reverse....not in the movie. The first 2 deaths pay obvious homage to the original movie but lack the malice and intent. Later scenes don't even tryThe final scene appears to take place 3-5 years after the rest of the story, making the final line laughably obsoleteThere may be a plan to implement a parallel series of stories even as Omen 2 and maybe 3 happen undisturbed out of sight. If so, that could be fun storytelling. But unless they retcon the retcon, they won't be Omen storys.\n\n                    15 out of 36 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Used a big named 3 person cast to its fullest , and introduced a stunning, relatively unknown lead and supporting cast to its fullest. Beautifully shot, framed, paced and sympathetically made a movie that\'s on par with all the greats from this era and at the same time done justice to the original film in every way and told a story that links so perfectly in to the original film , I can\'t quite believe it .

This prequel is directed by Arkasha Stevenson. This is her film directorial debut, before which she has only directed episodes of various TV series.The young American Margaret (Neil Tiger Free) has been sent to Italy to live in the service of the church. During her time at the church, she learns about hidden, dark actions at the church as they seek to bring the Antichrist to life.With this prequel they respond well to the original Omen film from 1976. This original film has already had sequels, spin-offs and a remake. All these films after the original Omen often did not work very successfully, but this new prequel seems to change that after years. With this prequel they respond well to the story that happened before the original film. They know how to create a good, exciting, but also equal atmosphere with this new Omen film. The only disadvantage of the fact that the film responds so well to the original Omen film is that it can make this prequel a bit predictable at times. As a connoisseur of the classic Omen film, you can anticipate this prequel.In addition to the predictable aspects that the film can have for connoisseurs, the film also has an incorrect outcome date. This film is very similar to the horror film Immaculate, which was released in cinemas a week earlier. Due to the similar horror stories, it can feel a bit repetitive when you see these two films in two weeks in a row.With horror aspects, with this film they do not play much on horror clichés such as lame jump scares, but manage to create a more religious horror atmosphere around the birth of the Antichrist. This is not a sadistic body horror film, but focuses more on the aspects involved in birth. They seem to have used so many real effects for this, which also made some more of the cast members ragged.Nell Tiger Free also carries this film as the lead, who learns about dark secrets in her church. Together with the other cast members, she and the rest play the characters well and appropriately enough, making it seem like they are also from the 1976 film.\n\n                    22 out of 58 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Sadly the prequel couldn\'t be bloody and horrific enough, yet it didn\'t scare me. Predictable plot as well which never truly disturbed, almost disrespects the 1976 classic. Nevermind. The promising title, the idea wasn\'t too bad either, I must\'ve had too high expectations. Could\'ve been so much more than just chopped limbs and horrifying nuns. As for ancient Rome\'s sightseeing, it wasn\'t too bad to watch.Ritual birth in a dungeon, victim strapped to a gurney, surrounded by complicit nuns, candle fire and crucifix is kinda overdone. Even the notorious birthmark was too obvious. I guess just pass it onto the next Omen.Typically some of it reminded me of a similar plot inspired from classics like ""Rosemary\'s Baby"" (take note of the baby\'s claws). Like the actual first born could be just as well an ""Aliens"" rip- off. Based on the 2006 prequel (Mia Farrow) confusingly The First Omen could be just as well watched in reverse order. Appropriate 6/6 rating.\n\n                    5 out of 10 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

The script is a prequel that tells us the story of Damien Thorn\'s birth, and it does so in an effective and gloomy way, at times it seems predictable but soon there are wonderfully designed twists, as well as including tribute scenes to the first film from 1976. The director Arkasha Stevenson\'s work is first class, she tells this story in a slow way that is full of emotions, together with the editing work, the film gives a result of art cinema, with the vein of current classics such as ""The VVitch"" (2015), ""Heriditary"" (2018) or ""Suspiria"" (2018) to name a few. The art direction and filming locations were carefully chosen, resulting in a visual delight that the cinematography manages to exalt in each scene. The costume design transports you to the beginning of the \'70s, although sometimes it falls into anachronisms such as extras who wear costumes that belong to the mid- and late \'70s and not the beginning of these, there is even disco music that in 1971 had not yet been played, an example is the classic ""Daddy Cool"" by Boney M. The soundtrack by Mark Korven is an auditory delight and evokes the soundtrack he made for ""The VVitch"" in 2015. The effects are well done, it is appreciated to be able to see old school special effects, with the exception of a couple of scenes that use digital effects but decent and moderately. The makeup effects are realistic and gloomy. The film, being a co-production between the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Canada and Serbia, provides elements that are reminiscent of Italian cinema from the \'70s, in addition to paying tribute to classics such as ""Rosemary\'s Baby"" (1968), ""Suspiria"" (1977), ""Possession"" (1981) and remembering the atmosphere that ""The Omen"" trilogy gave a gift in its time. ""The First Omen"" is a formidable film, the best horror film of the year so far.\n\n                    63 out of 129 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?
